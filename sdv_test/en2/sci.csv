First, we confirmed the accuracy of the nonlinear analysis in the model test. Next, we carried out nonlinear transient electric field analysis for polarity reversal test of the converter transformer. In the results, when the applied time of dc voltage before the polarity reversal is 360 min, the values of the electric field of oil area are the same as when it is 90 min. Although, the electric field in the pressboard becomes higher in response to the applied time dc voltage, it does not cause a problem on the insulation. Because withstand voltage of pressboard is very high. In the results, the correlation between the applied time of dc voltage before the polarity reversal and the withstand voltage of transformer is considered low. This result can be applied to the design of the converter transformer. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Published online inWileyOnline Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com).",2017,198,9,DX5QL,2018/6/28
WOS:000384436200002,"Endo, E",Influence of Resource Allocation in PV Technology Development of Japan on the World and Domestic PV Market,English,Article,"This paper analyzes influence of resource allocation in R&D of solar cells in Japan. First, it estimates solar cell price in Japan in the case resource allocation for R&D of crystalline silicon solar cells was not significantly reduced, but maintained almost constant level. For the projection, it does not use experience curve, but models technological progress, price reduction, of solar cell in Japan with a variable technology knowledge stock by excluding mass production effects. Second, solar cell prices in other countries are estimated based on their market share in the global solar cell production. The estimated solar cell price in Japan under the assumed resource allocation decreases by about 30% compared to the actual one and it, therefore, could be competitive to the estimated solar cell prices in China and Taiwan. In this case, Japan could maintain its top market share in the global solar cell production several years longer. Instead of the Japan's Feed-in Tariff with subsidy, net-metering without subsidy is enough for keeping almost the same internal rate of return of residential PV systems for new and existing houses. This paper will be helpful to cost-effective R&D planning by a modeling and simulation approach. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,198,13,DX5QL,2018/6/28

The RNA has been applied to the dynamic analysis of several motors such as a surface permanent magnet (SPM) motor, an interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor, and a switched reluctance (SR) motor. The dynamic characteristics of these motors including starting and a sudden load change can be calculated by an RNA. However, the torque calculation methods for these motors are different from each other. This paper presents a unified calculation method for the motor torque in an RNA, which does not depend on the types and structures of motors. The validity and availability of the proposed method are demonstrated by a finite element method (FEM) and an experiment. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,198,9,DX5QL,2018/6/28

In preceding research, it has been shown that the D-axis negative current reduces the 2nd radial electromagnetic force. In contrast, a relationship between this force and the current has not been clarified. In this paper, it is demonstrated that this force is separated into three forces caused by the D-axis current, the Q-axis current, and the flux of the magnet. An equation correlating this force and the current is developed by using a finite element analysis. On the basis of this equation, vibration control is proposed to reduce this force.

The heat generated by current amplifiers becomes a problem as the positioning speed of the Galvano scanner is increased. The proposed method involves the use of a final-state control that considers the voltage constraint of a current amplifier. By constraining the applied voltage to the motor, the power supply voltage of the current amplifier is reduced. Therefore, the electricity consumed and the heat generated by the current amplifier can be reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through simulation and experimental results.

The mixing of the axial flow with cross flow in structured bed have been studied experimentally in a test box. The test box containing a 924 spherical particles of 52mm diameter were arranged to achieve the simple cubic configuration which leads to a porosity of 0.48. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been carried out corresponding to the experimental setup. ANSYS 14 was used for CFD simulation with standard k-epsilon turbulence model. Fixed bed model (FBM) and porous media model (PMM) are used in this numerical work. Three different methods of contact point treatment are considered to obtain results using FBM. Moreover, results obtained through FBM (gap method) and PMM were also compared. Cross flow mixing takes place between N-2 entering via side injection and air entering at the bottom of the test box. Parametric variables are; lance diameter, lance position, and volume flow rate ratio. It is shown that results of CFD simulations using FBM can predict the cross flow mixing reasonably. The curves for O-2 concentration obtained through PMM are shifted little bit away from curves of FBM. It is also interesting to note that results of FBM with gap method fit best with the experimentally data.",2017,11,14,EA1FS,2018/6/28

The first and second spatial derivatives of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized by the sixth-order central compact finite-difference schemes. Two flow fields are simulated. The first test case is the simulated flow around a square cylinder, with the results providing good estimations of the wake region mechanics and vortex shedding. The second test case is the simulated flow around a circular cylinder. This case was selected to better understand the effects of sharp corners on the force coefficients. It was observed that the estimation of the force coefficients did not result in any troubles in the case of a circular cylinder. Additionally, the performance values obtained for the calculation time for the solution of the Poisson equation are compared with the values for other CPUs and GPUs from the literature.

The investigation shows that the pressure pulsation, velocity fluctuations and the size of the vortex rope decrease when the jet is injected from the runner crown. The flow rate of the jet is less than 3% of the flow rate of the swirl generator.

WOS:000386338500004,"Bontempo, R; Manna, M",Actuator disc methods for open propellers: assessments of numerical methods,English,Article,"The paper describes the assessment of two different actuator disc models as applied to the flow around open propellers. The first method is based on a semi-analytical approach returning the solution for the nonlinear differential equation governing the axisymmetric, steady, inviscid and incompressible flow around an actuator disc. Despite its low computational cost, the method does not require simplifying assumptions regarding the shape of the slipstream, e.g. the wake contraction is not disregarded or prescribed in advance. Moreover, the presence of a tangential velocity in the wake as well as the spanwise variation of the load are taken into account. The second one is a commonly used procedure based on CFD techniques in which the effects of the propeller are synthetically described through a set of body forces distributed over the disc surface. Both methods avoid the difficulties and the computational costs associated with the resolution of the propeller blades geometrical details. The comparison is based on an in-depth error analysis of the two procedures which results in a set of reference data with controlled accuracy. An excellent agreement has been documented between the two methods while the computational complexity is obviously very different. Among other things the comparison is also aimed at verifying the accuracy of the semi-analytical approach at each point of the computational domain and at quantifying the effect of the errors embodied in the two methods on the quality of the solution, both in terms of global and local performance parameters. Furthermore, the paper provides a set of reference solutions with controlled accuracy that could be used for the verification of new and existing computational methods. Finally, the computational cost of the semi-analytical model is quantified, thus providing a valuable information to designers who need to select a cost effective and reliable analysis tool.",2017,11,12,EA1FS,2018/6/28

This highly fossiliferous deposit (the Ten Bits Microsite') yielded about 5000 teeth, spines, and denticles in a small amount of matrix (c. 150 kg). About 30 identifiable species of sharks, rays, and bony fishes are recognized. Two of the three most abundant chondrichthyan species at Ten Bits (Scapanorhynchus texanus and Ischyrhiza mira) are also the most common species in other middle to late Campanian marine vertebrate faunas along the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain. The myliobatiform rays Brachyrhizodus and Rhombodus that occur at Ten Bits also appear to be characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, as are lamniform sharks such as Cretalamna and Serratolamna. These taxa are entirely absent or extremely rare in Western Interior Campanian faunas. In contrast, some small orectolobiform sharks (Cantioscyllium, Chiloscyllium, Columbusia) and small rays (Protoplatyrhina) found at Ten Bits are common in shallow water faunas of the Western Interior and Texas Coastal Plain, but rarely reported from the eastern Gulf or Atlantic Coast. The common Western Interior ray Myledaphus bipartitus does not occur at Ten Bits or in any Gulf or Atlantic Coast fauna. Ptychotrygon agujaensis is abundantly represented in the Ten Bits fauna, but unknown in correlative marine faunas. Although Ptychotrygon occurs in all Western Interior, Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas, it is represented elsewhere by apparently endemic species at each collection site. The differences between Western Interior, Gulf, and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas probably reflect latitudinal variation in water temperature or salinity, or different oceanic water circulation patterns between the Western Interior Seaway and the Gulf or Atlantic Coast that restricted the distributions of some marine fish species. The Ten Bits fauna shares typical species with both Western Interior and Gulf and Atlantic Coast faunas, reflecting its position at the border between these provinces; however, the dominant taxa found at Ten Bits are the same as those found on the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and indicate that western Texas was more closely allied biogeographically with that province than with the Western Interior of North America. One species tentatively identified in the Ten Bits fauna on the basis of a single tooth, Igdabatis cf. I. indicus, is otherwise known only from southern Europe and Asia, although a similar large myliobatid ray also occurs rarely in Texas Coastal Plain faunas. These occurrences indicate that western Texas may have been near the northern limit of the range for some tropical Tethyan marine vertebrate species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

WOS:000386739700003,"Lowery, CM; Leckie, RM; Sageman, BB",Micropaleontological evidence for redox changes in the OAE3 interval of the US Western Interior: Global vs. local processes,English,Article,"The Coniacian-Santonian interval has been proposed as the youngest of the Cretaceous ocean anoxic events (OAE3), but this designation has long been debated. OAE3 is associated with a long-lasting (similar to 3 myr) succession of black shales from the central and South Atlantic, Caribbean region, and the North American Western Interior; in the Western Interior it is characterized by an abrupt increase in total organic carbon (TOC) and corresponding trace metal indicators for anoxia. However, the modern concept of OAEs is predicated on detection of global carbon cycle perturbations as recorded by substantial carbon isotope excursions (CIE), and the protracted Coniacian-Santonian black shale interval does not have a large CIE. A more conservative definition of OAE3 might limit the event to the modest positive carbon isotope excursion restricted to the upper Coniacian Scaphites depressus Ammonite Zone. Trace metal proxies suggest that oxygen levels abruptly declined prior to the onset of this CIE in the Western Interior Sea (WIS), but it is unknown whether regional anoxic conditions were confined to sediments/pore waters, or how anoxia may have affected the biota. In an effort to characterize the oxygenation history of the WIS and to better understand the nature of the hypothesized OAE3, we present micropaleontological evidence of declining oxygen in bottom waters prior to the event using benthic foraminifera, which are sensitive to dissolved oxygen. Changes in benthic foraminiferal abundances suggest a decline in oxygen at least 1-myr prior to the CIE (including a nadir immediately below the start of the excursion), improving bottom water oxygen during the CIE, and re-establishment of persistent anoxia following the isotope excursion. Anoxia endured for nearly 3 myr in the central seaway, showing some signs of recovery toward the top of the Niobrara Formation. Our findings suggest that declining oxygen concentrations in the seaway eventually reached a tipping point, after which dissolved oxygen quickly dropped to zero. The late Coniacian CIE is an exception to the trend of declining oxygen in the WIS, and part of a larger pattern in the oxygenation history of the Niobrara Formation which suggests that it does not adhere to standard black shale models. Transgressive periods, including the Fort Hays Limestone and the lower limestone unit of the Smoky Hill Shale (which corresponds to the CIE) are relatively oxic, while periods of highstand (i.e., most of the Smoky Hill) correspond to deteriorating oxygen conditions. This contrasts with the standard black shale model for sea level and oxygen, where transgressions typically correlate with maximum TOC enrichment, interpreted to result from both sediment condensation and oxygen deficiency. The association of global carbon burial/anoxia (as indicated by carbon isotopes) with a regional increase in oxygen and decrease in organic matter preservation is reminiscent of the Cenomanian-Turonian Greenhorn Limestone, which contains OAE2. In both cases, the facies are not typical black shales, but instead have appreciable carbonate content Western Interior redox trends support the rejection of the original concept of a protracted Coniacian-Santonian OAE3 because it is not a distinct ""event"" Increasing local oxygen during the late Coniacian CIE also argues against a narrower OAE designation for this event, because the excursion can't be tied to anoxia here or anywhere else it has been described. Nevertheless, the Late Coniacian Event (as we prefer to call this CIE) still represents an important perturbation of the global carbon cycle. This is emblematic of the shift away from widespread, discrete anoxic events during the ongoing paleoceanographic reorganization of the Late Cretaceous, even as large carbon cycle perturbations continued.

For Ekrixinatosaurus, for example, BL was estimated as 10-11 m or 7-8 m; for Pycnonemosaurus it was proposed 7-8 m, however its preserved bones are larger than any other described abelisauroid. The lack of a consistent methodology complicates comparisons of estimated BL, so we reevaluated the estimative for the seven most complete specimens of abelisauroids and compared the values against 40 measurements from the skull, vertebrae and appendicular elements using bivariate equations. It allowed estimating the BL of other 30, less complete, specimens of abelisauroids and to evaluate the allometric scaling of the skeletal parts. Strong correlations (R-2 > 0.96) were obtained for all vertebrae and hindlimb measurements, as well as skull height, and length of skull roof, lacrimal squamosal, scapulocoracoid and humerus; other skull and forelimb measurements present weak correlation due to extreme morphological transformations observed in Abelisauridae and were not adequate for BL estimation. Abelisauroids gradually increased in size during evolution: the mean BL was 3.3 +/- 2.5 m for basal abelisauroids and Noasauridae, 5.4 +/- 1.8 m for basal Brachyrostra and Majungasauridae, and 7.1 +/- 2.1 m for Furileusaura. Despite this variation, diversity of BL on each geographic region and stratigraphic epoch was relatively constant (BL usually varied from 4 to 8 m). The smallest noasaurid and abelisaurid are, respectively, Velocisaurus (1.5 +/- 0.1 m) and Genusaurus (3.6 +/- 0.0 m). The largest abelisaurids is Pycnonemosaurus nevesi (8.9 +/- 0.3 m) followed by Carnotaurus (7.8 +/- 0.3 m), Abelisaurus (7.4 +/- 0.7 m) and Ekrixinatosaurus (7.4 +/- 0.8 m). Skull measurement scale negatively at a similar rate but the height scales almost isometrically and the skull roof length scales more negatively; this probably caused a bending on the skull that may explain the upward orientation of the snout in large taxa.

Similarities between T. zelenitskyae oosp. nov. and Adocus sp. eggs, along with comparable body size, suggest that this taxon might have produced MOR 710.

It is undoubtedly placed in extant subfamily Malthininae based on its small-sized body, somewhat abbreviated elytra and fusiform terminal maxillary palpomere, representing the oldest documented occurrence of Malthininae. It suggests that this subfamily is an ancient group, which originated at least in the earliest Late Cretaceous. Our discovery sheds light on the palaeodiversity of Cantharidae in the Late Mesozoic. Together with other previously reported fossil cantharids, it is likely that Malthininae has been fairly diverse during the early evolution of Cantharidae. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Archaeomalthodes and Recent malthinines and the occurrence of flowering plants in the Burmese amber implies a potential flower-visiting behaviour of this fossil species.

Most taxa are known only by isolated rostral spines, whereas skeletal remains are rare and have been reported from a small number of Upper Cretaceous localities. Here, we describe skeletal remains of the giant sclerorhynchiform Onchosaurus pharao for the first time, which provides new morphological information. The single specimen comes from middle-basal upper Turonian strata of the Lessini Mountains in northeastern Italy and represents the first record of this genus from Italy. The specimen consists of unidentifiable cranial remains, several diagnostic rostral spines, the rostrum with fragments of tessellated calcified cartilage, and 87 disarticulated vertebrae. The rostrum preserves the characteristic sensory system of sclerorhynchiforms. It is devoid of any lateral sockets indicating that rostral spines were attached laterally to its surface. This pattern is identical to most sclerorhynchiforms and extant pristiophoriformes implying also similar replacement patterns as in most other sclerorhynchiforms with the exception for Schizorhiza. Additionally, the bases of two longitudinally arranged rows of ventral rostral spines are identifiable concurring with patterns seen in Sclerorhynchus. The axial skeleton is partly preserved. Re-arranging the disarticulated vertebrae according to their life position in combination with measures of the size and thickness of preserved vertebral centra, and the ratio rostrum length/body size depending on the number of vertebral centra indicate that the specimen was ca. 450 cm long. Growth rings in the vertebral centra show that the specimen was about four years old and thus probably not yet fully sexual mature when it died. This age assumption corresponds well with the calculated size when compared with complete skeletons of extinct sclerorhynchiforms and extant pristiforms. The size of the specimen and its occurrence in hemipelagic rocks corroborates previous assumptions that this sclerorhynchiform was a large and pelagic sawfish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sauropod remains are very rare at all these localities and represented usually only by isolated teeth. Only narrow-crowned teeth are known from the Cretaceous of Central Asia. The oldest record of such teeth is from the Aptian Sultanbobo Formation of Uzbekistan. Exposures of the Turonian Bissekty Formation at the most productive vertebrate locality in the region, Dzharakuduk in Uzbekistan, has yielded many isolated teeth and a few skeletal remains that can be attributed to a non-lithostrotian titanosaur. Similar narrow-crowned, cylindrical teeth from Cenomanian-to Coniacian-age strata in the Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan, may belong to a closely related taxon. Another taxon, with teeth that are pentagonal in cross-section, is known from the Santonian Yalovach and Bostobe formations of Tajikistan and western Kazakhstan, respectively. A femur reported from the Santonian Syuksyuk Formation of southern Kazakhstan possibly belongs to a lithostrotian titanosaur. The change in tooth structure at the Coniacian-Santonian boundary in the region possibly suggests replacement of non-lithostrotian titanosaurs by lithostrotians. The titanosaur from the Bissekty Formation is similar to Dongyangosaurus sinensis from the Cenomanian-Turonian of Zhejiang (China) in the extensive pneumatization of the neural arch on the anterior caudal vertebrae with several fossae. It also resembles Baotianmansaurus henanensis from the Cenomanian of Henan (China) in the possession of very short anterior caudal centra.

However, the efficiency of an electromagnetic resonant coupling type WPT system with LC resonators is greatly affected by the layout of the LC resonators allocated in the system. This means that there is an optimum layout for the LC resonators for transferring wireless power at higher efficiency. This paper presents a new method for identifying the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. One of the key ideas is that the problem of finding the optimum layout is replaced by the problem of calculating the equivalent current sources in the LC resonators. The amplitude of the equivalent current sources can be calculated to solve ill-posed system equations by using inverse analysis. First, the proposed method is described. The system equations to be solved are formulated by means of equivalent circuit techniques. Second, the proposed method is applied to a simplified model to identify the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. Then, the results found using the proposed method are verified by comparing the ratio of receiving power with the identified layout and without the LC resonator. Finally, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, the calculated results are compared with the experiment results using the same model.

The t-axis is a tangent line of a constant voltage ellipse, and the n-axis is a normal line of the ellipse. On the n-t coordinate system, the n-axis current is not affected by the voltage phase. The n-axis current is utilized to reduce the mutual coupling between the voltage amplitude controller and phase controller. The proposed method realizes a high torque response for the linear range and overmodulation range of the inverter, including six-step mode. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by simulation and experimental results. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,198,9,EB1VJ,2018/6/28

AC-DC converters require a unity input power factor characteristic with highly efficient operation to prevent the inflow of harmonic current to the power source. The proposed PFC converter improves the input current ripple with interleave control. The converter realizes a high efficiency by the soft-switching operation of all switching devices without a large auxiliary resonant circuit. This paper introduces the soft-switching operation of the converter. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed converter, experiments with a prototype of the PFC converter have been performed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed converter can realize the soft-switching operation of all switching devices, a reduction in the input current ripple, a unity power factor of 98% or more, a sinusoidal input current, and constant output voltage control. The efficiency of the proposed PFC converter with a lossless snubber is higher than that without the lossless snubber. The results presented in this paper confirm the validity of the proposed converter. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,198,10,EB1VJ,2018/6/28

This is compared with the conventional batch extraction in parallel. Continuous operation of a process involving liquid liquid extraction and then two-phase separation is achieved instantly. For the latter a micro-scale separator is used. Compared with batch extraction, the segmented micro-flow extraction process shows order-of-magnitude faster extraction times, higher extraction ability for Co, lower extraction for Ni, and then a better selectivity between Co and Ni at industrial-matching concentration. Regular columnar slugs are observed at low flow rates and found to be a Gaussian function of the flow rates. Matched in and outlet flows indicates that extraction in micro-flow is dependent on mass transfer by molecular diffusion. Extraction efficiency is enhanced by the internal circulation flow generated within slugs. Additionally, the characteristic parameters, overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L)alpha and overall mass transfer coefficient k(L), are measured to determine the mass transfer performance. Compared with batch, much higher k(L)alpha. of Co (0.26-0.017 s(-1)) and smaller of Ni (0.053-0.013 s(-1)) are investigated in CFI. Meanwhile, 4.5 times increasement of the k(L) value of Co to Ni is observed in CFI indicating the asynchronous extraction between Co and Ni. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that this engineering device can be implemented under mild reaction conditions (low temperature and pressure) and outside the explosive regime (low hydrogen concentration), making it appealing for industrial applications. The ceramic membrane allows for a separate feed of the reactants, therefore addressing the PO selectivity issue related to the propylene hydrogenation. The reaction is operated in a continuous methanol flow fed with propylene inside the tubular membrane; hydrogen and oxygen are fed through the porous, material. We observe that the feeding strategy of the reactants has an important effect on key parameters such as PO selectivity and productivity. By separating propylene from hydrogen, the propane formation was reduced with respect to conventional packed bed reactors. Moreover, the addition of small amounts of NaBr to the reaction medium increases the catalytic activity to PO, but also to propane formation. Therefore, this study provides a good starting point in the design of a membrane reactor device for the direct synthesis of PO where the main limitations such as propylene hydrogenation and water formation can be addressed.

Meanwhile, the effects of some operational parameters including initial concentration of H2O2 (29-580 mM), pH (3.3-10), and contact time (10-180 min) on the removal efficiency of TC were measured. The results showed that the removal of TC increased with increasing initial H2O2 dosage, pH and treatment time, and about 97% of TC was removed by H2O2 with the concentration of 174 mM in alkaline aqueous solution. Experiments with different scavengers indicated that TC degradation occurred via a direct molecular reaction instead of active radicals. Nine transformation products were identified, but only three ones were the final products. These products resulted from hydroxylation, loss of some functional groups and cleavage of benzene rings of TC.

But the NOx reduction efficiency is highly inhibited by oxygen present in the flue gas. In this research, a rotary reactor was proposed for the treatment of NOx in oxygen-rich flue gases. In the proposed rotary reactor, an adsorption zone and a reduction zone were configured in such a way that the flue gas stream, containing NOx and oxygen, and the reducing gas stream, containing CO, are introduced into the reactor separately. Loaded catalysts were rotated between the two zones to adsorb NOx from the flue gas in the adsorption zone and then reduce the adsorbed NOx by CO in the reduction zone. The performance of the rotary reactor was investigated in a fixed bed reactor loaded with Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts synthesized in the lab, and the dynamic adsorption reduction process was simulated by switching the inlet gas stream. The results showed that the simulated rotary reactor could well remove and reduce NOx from oxygen containing flue gases. NOx removal efficiencies were very stable in the investigated temperature range, i.e., 250-400 degrees C. Higher CO concentration could significantly enhance both NOx removal and reduction efficiencies. The amount of CO slipping into the adsorption zone was very low even though CO is in great excess. In order to explore the reaction mechanism, in situ DRIFT study was performed. It was found that CO could occupy the active Fe sites, promoting NOx desorption and the subsequence NOx removal in the adsorption stage. But the active intermediates for NOx reduction is not effectively formed during CO purging, resulting in a lower NOx reduction efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Effective pretreatment is required to mitigate membrane fouling and in this paper we have evaluated the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculation with alum coagulation. Bench scale tests were conducted over extended periods with two types of PAM (different molecular weights (MW)) applied with, and without alum coagulation, in order to investigate their impact on membrane fouling. The structure of the resulting flocs formed in the process and the activity of bacteria within the membrane tank were identified as two key factors influencing UF system performance. It was found that development of the cake layer and hydraulic resistance of the membrane were influenced by the floc properties, which were in turn related to the MW and dose of the PAM. Coagulation and flocculation using the larger MW PAM formed amorphous flocs with a lower fractal dimension, which contributed to a lower density of the cake layer and lower rate of increase in trans-membrane pressure. PAM flocculation without alum coagulation induced severe membrane fouling by forming a continuous gel-like layer on the membrane surface. By alum-PAM dosing it was found that the concentration of bacteria present in the membrane tank and adhering to the cake layer, was sufficient to remove nearly all of the ammonia and around 80% phosphorus in the raw water. These results demonstrate that the combination of a high MW PAM with alum as a pretreatment method of UF process can effectively improve the floc properties and cake layer structure for controlling membrane fouling and producing high quality treated water.

However, the cost of carbon capture has to be reduced to manageable levels before it can be deployed at an industrial scale. Potassium carbonate solutions (K2CO3) are good solvents for CO2 capture because they have low regeneration energy, low degradation rates and low corrosivity. However, one shortcoming of K2CO3 is that it has slow reaction kinetics with CO2. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of promoters to K2CO3 solutions. In this study, the catalysis kinetics of a carbonic anhydrase (NZCA) promoter was tested via the stopped flow technique and a wetted wall column (WWC). The Michaelis-Menten catalysis parameter (k(cat)/K-m) was determined to be 2.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) at 298 K, allowing the catalysis reaction activation energy of 51 +/- 1 kJ/mol to be obtained at 298-328 K. The catalysis coefficient of the NZCA was determined to be 5.3 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) using a WWC in 30 wt% potassium carbonate solutions (pH similar to 11-12) at 323 K.

The combination of V doping, which enhanced internal electron transfer in the TiO2 lattice, and Ag doping, which exhibited high internal electron transfer in the Ag2O and enhanced exterior electron transfer among Ag particles, Ag2O and TiO2, increased the photocatalytic activity of Ag@V-TiO2/PU for the removal of VOCs in aerosol. The surface area of this co-doped photocatalyst was also higher than that of the undoped and single-dopant photo catalysts. The optimal combination of weight ratios of AgiTiO(2) and ViTiO(2) for maximizing the surface area and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was 4 and 2%, respectively.

The individual removal of hexane and butyl acetate gas by Ag@V-TiO2/PU was similar; however, in the mixture stream of both VOCs, much more butyl acetate than hexane was photocatalytically removed. This was associated with the much higher polarity of butyl acetate than that of hexane, so that the photocatalyst surface, where most of the oxy radicals were generated to oxidize the VOCs, was more occupied or covered by butyl acetate than by hexane.

To do that, experiments were carried out in a pseudo-2D fluidized bed using glass beads as bed material. The glass beads have the same density and diameter but half of them are painted in black to make them distinguishable. At the beginning of each experiment, the particles were placed in a completely lateral segregated state and then the fluidizing air was suddenly injected while images were recorded. The images were processed to obtain the mixing index evolution with time. Two different regions where differentiated in the evolution of the lateral mixing with time: a region dominated by convective mixing and a region governed by diffusive mixing. Both the start-up time and the total solids mixing time were characterized. The total solids mixing time was found to have a potential relation with the excess gas velocity and it was found to be independent of the particle size. This total solids mixing time was compared to the residence time of the bubbles in the bed and it was showed that the axial solids mixing is two orders of magnitude faster than the lateral solids mixing. This result justifies the use of the 1D Fickian-type diffusion equation to fit the experimental data of the mixing index obtaining the values of the lateral dispersion coefficient.

Metaldehyde, used as the challenge molecule in this study, is a common molluscicide that (like many highly soluble contaminants) has frequently breached European regulatory limits in surface waters. The new method involves graphene with higher hydrophilic characteristics (single-layer graphene oxide, SLGO) as a system that participates in a redox reaction with hydrogen peroxide and which can potentially stabilize the OH generated, which subsequently breaks down organic contaminants. The modified Fenton's reaction has shown to be effective in degrading metaldehyde in natural waters (>92% removal), even at high contaminant concentrations (50 mg metaldehyde/L) and in the presence of high background organic matter and dissolved salts. The reaction is relatively pH insensitive. SLGO maintained its catalytic performance over 3 treatment cycles when immobilized. Its performance gradually decreased over time, reaching around 50% of starting performance on the 10th treatment cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of modifications caused in SLGO by the oxidizing treatment indicated that the oxidation of C-C sp(2) to carbonyl groups may be the cause of the decrease in performance. The proposed modified Fenton's process has the potential to substitute traditional Fenton's treatment although regeneration of the nanocarbon is required for its prolonged use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a proof of concept, a therapeutic agent (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) and two types of shell materials (phospholipid and bovine serum albumin, BSA) were selected to produce tPA-entrapped MBs. Investigation using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled tPA revealed that the tPA-loaded MBs were successfully fabricated in a one-step procedure and the tPA was located in the shell layer for both the BSA and lipid MBs. By optimization of the operating conditions in terms of voltage, core/shell flow rate ratio as well as tPA volume ratio, minimum bubble sizes for tPA-BSA and tPA-lipid MBs were obtained. The fabricated tPA-BSA MBs was 41 mu m in mean diameter while similar to 41% of the tPA-lipid MBs ranged from 3 to 6 mu m and similar to 36% of them ranged from 6 to 9 mu m under optimal operating conditions. Sensitivity analysis on the effects of key process parameters was also performed to guide design and manipulation of bubble sizes. The investigation of gas phase showed that the usage of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as the core can enhance the stability of tPA-lipid bubbles. The presented one-step method displayed great flexibility for producing tPA-loaded MBs and thus can potentially serve as a new tool to generate/engineer tPA-bubbles for applications in ischemic stroke therapy.

TiO2 and AgiTiO(2) were prepared by a solvothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. The activity of the photocatalysts was evaluated by decomposition rate of NO and yield of N-2, respectively. It was found that although photodecomposition of NO over pure TiO2 is very quick, NO has not been converted into N-2 and O-2. It means that some by-products have formed. N-2 formation is a relatively slower process. It was found that the selectivity for photodecomposition of NOx into N-2 can be significantly improved by introducing appropriate amount of Ag into TiO2. The 1 wt% Ag loaded on TiO2 showed the highest activity for both NO decomposition and N-2 production. The possible mechanism for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of anatase AgiTiO(2) was attributed to the coexistence of Ag and Ag+ on the surface of TiO2, with a Ag+/Ag ratio of ca. 0.86, which played different roles in the photo catalytic process. Our study could be valuable for the development of efficient photocatalyst for NOx photodecomposition with a high selectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,307,8,EB3VY,2018/6/28

Incorporation of graphene oxide with magnetite nanoparticles through co-precipitation enhances separation of a newly designed magnetite graphene oxide by a magnetic field. Considering the instability of magnetite graphene oxide under different water chemistry conditions, we designed encapsulated magnetite graphene oxide inside a non-toxic alginate bead as a high-performance green chemical for the uptake of Cr(VI) and As(V) in water treatment applications (mGO/bead). The alginate, itself revealed low contribution for metal ions uptake, however this could potentially inhibit the aggregation of magnetite graphene oxide powder showing enhanced performance to extract metals from water. Material capacity minimally altered over a range of pH values for As(V), while Cr(VI) uptake varied with pH changes, which were explained by a local pH-controlled mechanism. Induced hydrolysis was facilitated by the release of Fe3+ from Fe3+-crosslinked mGO/beads, thus enhancing the removal of Cr(VI). For a complex mixture of heavy metals, influence of the presence of co-occurring ions in a mixed contaminant system (Cr(VI), As (V), Cu(II), Cd(II)) revealed an excellent performance (similar to 80-100% removal) by the composite material. The mGO/bead maintained its activity in wastewater and exhibited greater adsorption efficiency for both Cr(VI) and As(V) compared with activated carbon and carbon nanotube. The mGO/beads could be collected and reused for at least 5 cycles without the leaching of core mineral contents.

The adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent for the removal of Sb(III) was evaluated under the effects of concentration, temperature, contact time, medium pH, and re-usability.

The Langmuir modeling results revealed that the synthesized PAG sorbent had a considerably high adsorption capacity (158.2 mg/g) for Sb(III) ions from aqueous solution. The adsorption data fitted well into pseudo-second order model. The exothermic enthalpy change of -65.6 kJ/mol and negative Gibbs free energy change assured the viability of the adsorption process under the considered temperature conditions.

We also report the electrochemical properties of synergic Fe-2(MoO4)(3)/MWCNT composites as lithium-ion battery anode for the first time. Here, 1D Fe-2(MoO4)(3) nanorods serve as a strain accommodative matrix imparting stability while the entrenched OD Fe-2(MoO4)(3) nanoparticles offer a large number of active sites yielding high capacity.

A correct assessment of the equilibrium and kinetics of adsorption is extremely important for the design and operation of adsorption based processes. In our previous studies we focused on the evaluation of the equilibrium of CO2/CH4 adsorption on cherry stone-based carbons. In the present paper the kinetics of adsorption of CO2 on two cherry stone-based activated carbons (CS-H2O and CS-CO2), previously prepared in our laboratory, has been evaluated by means of transient breakthrough experiments at different CO2/CH4 feed concentrations, at atmospheric pressure and 30 degrees C. A commercial activated carbon, Calgon BPL, has also been evaluated for reference purposes. Three models have been applied to estimate the rate parameters during the adsorption of CO2 on these carbons, pseudo-first, pseudo-second and Avrami's fractional order kinetic models. Avrami's model accurately predicted the dynamic CO2 adsorption performance of the carbons for the different feed gas compositions. To further investigate the mechanism of CO2 adsorption on CS-H2O, CS-CO2 and Calgon BPL, intra-particle diffusion and Boyd's film-diffusion models were also evaluated. It was established that mass transfer during the adsorption of CO2 from CO2/CH4 is a diffusion-based process and that the main diffusion mechanisms involved are intra-particle and film diffusion. At the initial stages of adsorption, film diffusion resistance governed the adsorption rate, whereas intra-particle diffusion resistance was the predominant factor in the following stages of adsorption.

Basic pulse shapes were perceived as discs, curtains and bowls, which occurred randomly. The key characteristics, i.e. frequency, velocity and volume of pulses as well as peak and time-averaged liquid holdup, have been extracted by applying a dynamic threshold criterion to time variant liquid holdup profiles. The key properties strongly depend on axial position, pore density and fluid fluxes and can be distinguished in a local and global mode of pulsing. In the local mode, which evolves close to the regime transition boundary, pulses with small liquid volumes move slowly but frequently through the solid foam packed reactor. However, significantly faster pulses with large liquid volumes were encountered in the global mode. The larger pulses cover most of the reactor's cross section but occur less frequently.

Monomolecular protolytic cracking routes were mainly initiated by attack of acid sites on C-H or C-2-C-3 bonds. Operating conditions or zeolite pore caliber can tailor not only the first scission, but also the balance among carbenium ions related routes, e.g. hydride transfer, deprotonation, side reactions, etc. Increasing reaction temperature or zeolite pore caliber promoted the cleavage of C-H bond, and large pore caliber and high conversion were beneficial to the hydride transfer and side reactions. Compared to HZSM-35 and H-Beta, HZSM-5 zeolite with middle pore caliber exhibited the highest selectivity to light olefins, and Agincorporation can further promoted selectivity to light olefins at a little cost of P/E (propylene to ethylene) ratio. Promotion of Ag-incorporation on light olefins formation was probably due to the active sites generated by silver species acting as dehydrogenation sites, and enhancing the cleavage of C-H bond.

In batch experiments, per sulfate was compared with H2O2 and permanganate for oxidation of organic compounds in CGW. Complementary experiments were conducted to evaluate biodegradation (natural attenuation) potential for the system. Persulfate was observed to be superior to H2O2 and permanganate for degradation of total organic carbon (TOC) in the CGW. Conversely, biodegradation caused only partial removal of TOC in CGW. In contrast, persulfate caused complete degradation of the TOC in the CGW or aged CGW, showing no selectivity to the contaminants. Magnetite (Fe3O4) enhanced degradation of leachate compounds in both CGW and aged CGW with limited increase in persulfate consumption and sulfate production. Under dynamic flow condition in 1-D column experiment, both biodegradation and persulfate oxidation of TOC were enhanced by Fe3O4. The enhancement, however, was significantly greater for persulfate oxidation. In both batch and column experiments, Fe3O4 by itself caused minimal consumption of persulfate and production of sulfate, indicating that magnetite is a good persulfate activator for treating CGW in heterogeneous systems The results of the study show that the persulfate-based in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) method has great potential to treat the groundwater contaminated by landfill leachate.

Exchangeable Ca2+ compensating for negative charges of montmorillonite reacted with the added H2O2, affording nano CaO2 on the surface or in the interlayer regions of montmorillonite (montmorillonite-supported nano CaO2, MMT-nano CaO2). The catalytic capacity of montmorillonite for generating (OH)-O-center dot from nano CaO2 was verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), therefore, the radical oxidation induced by MMT-nano CaO2 can destruct the floc structure of WAS with the omission of Fe(II), the conventionally used catalyst for Fenton reaction. As a result, the reduction in specific resistance of filtration (SRF) by 62.2% was achieved with the MMT-nano CaO2 dosage of 100 mg/g dry solid (DS) and the weakly acidic pH of 5. (OH)-O-center dot led to the reduction of hydrophilic protein in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and the swelling behavior of montmorillonite contributed to the formation of a porous structure as draining medium for water withdrawing.

This study investigates the removal of RSCs, including H2S, and their oxidation product SO2 using Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation (GPAO). GPAO is a novel air cleaning technique which utilises accelerated atmospheric chemistry to oxidise pollutants before removing their oxidation products as particles. Removal efficiencies of 24.5% and 3.9% were found for 461 ppb of H2S and 714 ppb of SO2 in a laboratory system (volumetric flow Q = 75 m(3)/h). A numerical model of the reactor system was developed to explore the basic features of the system; its output was in fair agreement with the experiment. The model verified the role of OH radicals in initiating the oxidation chemistry. All sulphur removed from the gas phase was detected as particulate matter, assuming the observed particles were made of sulphuric acid. In a second set of experiments a range of RSCs at mixing ratios typically found in pig farms were treated using a larger industry-scale system (Q = 600-1200 m(3)/h) that included a wet scrubber. Removal efficiencies >90% were found for all compounds. The study demonstrates the ability of GPAO to control RSC emissions with a low energy input relative to many currently available techniques.

GO-Fe3O4 was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory. Nano-sized Fe3O4 anchored on GO uniformly, resulting in hybrid structures with well combination between GO and Fe3O4. By fitting to the pseudo 2nd-order model, chlorpheniramine adsorption onto GO-Fe3O4 likely occurred due to a chemical adsorption. The adsorption maximums decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 particles > GO-Fe3O4 suspension > activated carbon. With Fe3O4 changing the surface charge of GO-Fe3O4 suspension, pH variation enhanced chlorpheniramine adsorption on. GO-Fe3O4 suspension. The GO-Fe3O4 particles exhibited a relatively better but slow chlorpheniramine adsorption. More importantly, additional nanopore volumes and surface areas were created in GO-Fe3O4 particles due to low Fe3O4 contents to more effectively capture and remove chlorpheniramine, as Fe3O4 crystals on the GO surface potentially prevented the compaction of GO sheets. These factors interactively affected and determined the approach of using GO for removing chlorpheniramine or other pharmaceuticals with similar molecular characteristics in wastewater treatment.

The kinetic model of adsorption on the adsorbent sites described experimental data, consequently the adsorption itself is the rate-limiting step of the overall process, instead of diffusional steps. This kinetic model reduces to Langmuir isotherm in equilibrium condition, which in turn adequately described the solid-liquid interface equilibrium. Both kinetic, namely, adsorption kinetic constant (k(a)), and isotherm parameters: maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) and adsorbent adsorbate affinity (b) provided data to the thermodynamics investigation, which was evaluated by means of: (i) activation energy (E-a) calculated Arrhenius equation; and (ii) enthalpy of adsorption (Delta H) determined by the Henry constant with the estimated parameters.

This study investigated the effect of various inherent active constituents of four solid wastes (waste tire, cotton straw, Chinese medicinal residue and municipal solid waste) on the mercury removal performance of their derived chars. Modification methods (chemical impregnation and physical activation) were used to clarify modification influence on inherent active constituents and mercury removal performance of chars. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed decomposition technic (TPDT) and elemental mercury adsorption testing were used to measure and evaluate various chars. The results indicated that only waste tire generated mercury chemisorption sites (sulfide) during pyrolysis process. Sulfide could oxidize Hg-0 into HgS on char T6 derived from tire waste whereas sulfate could not on char derived from Chinese medicinal residue. The evaporation of element Cl during pyrolysis process led to the low adsorption capacity of municipal waste derived char. The modification methods impeded T6 mercury removal performance, but they promoted other three chars without chemisorption sites. The results provide meaningful guidance that the nature of raw materials should be taken into account during the preparation of mercury sorbents, and the preparation method should also vary for different raw materials.

However, there are still demands in energy efficiency enhancement and cost reduction. In this study, carbon black-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are used to produce H2O2 via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for in-situ oxidation of SO2 to SO42- in an electrolysis system. The effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and activated carbon (AC) as minor additive in the catalytic layers of GDEs is investigated. The results show that the MWCNTs play a positive role depending on its electrocatalysis for 2e-ORR, electron-bridge action and mesopore structure, giving the highest H2O2 production (1002.4 mg L-1), SO2 removal efficiency (98.0%) and reaction kinetics (0.52 mM min(-1)) and the lowest energy consumption (1.7 kW h kg(-1)) among the three GDEs. While the AC is adverse to the SO2 removal due to its excessive porous structure and catalysis on H2O2 reduction. The GDEs may be poisoned by SO32- or SO42- adsorption on active sites as sudden power failure and long-time running, but it can be restored by conducting only ORR, indicating great potential in industrial application.

Effects of various factors were assessed, such as the reaction temperature, the CA pH, the coexistence gases and the soluble anions. The results indicated that the desulfurization efficiencies were constant at 98-99.8% and the concentrations could be controlled below 35 mg/m(3) when the CA was used as absorbent. NO conversion efficiency reached approximately 98%. S(IV) species was characterized as a promoter for NO2 absorption, while Cl-, HCO3-, CO32- and NO2- inhibited the NO conversion.

Via a convenient and hydrothermal method, large-sized GR nanosheets can serve as substrate for monodispersed dispersion of C3N4 nanosheets. A subsequent loading of very small amount of CDots (1 wt%, 2-5 nm) onto sheet-on-sheet heterostructure significantly enhance visible-light-driven photoredox performances of catalysts, including oxidation of organics pollutant (RhB, 96.0%) and reduction of heavy metals [Cr(VI), 83.6%]. Excellent catalytic properties of GR/C3N4/CDots heterostructure can be predominantly ascribed to the intimate interfacial contact among constructing ingredients, increased specific surface area and enhanced light adsorption derived from GR and CDots carbon materials. Particularly, the synergistic sheet-on-sheet interaction between C3N4 and carbon materials (GR and CDots) remarkably accelerate the electrons/holes separation, giving rise to significantly enhanced photoredox performances of GR/C3N4/CDots in comparison with other counterparts.

It results in significant pressure fluctuation and particle loss, further brings about difficulties in establishing a stable solids circulation and blockage of the heat exchanger for recycling gas. However, the oscillation mechanism and hydrodynamic characteristics of the solids oscillation circulation are still far from understanding, since the variation of solids transfer rate, gas flow rate and their complex interactions are still unknown. In this work, the Eulierian-Eulerian method has been employed for the simulation of solids oscillation circulation in a two-dimension (2D) CFB. The results indicate that solids oscillation circulation is triggered by the formation of slugging in the downer, which leads to a decrease of the downer pressure drop and a sharp increase of the riser bypass gas velocity. Besides, intense slugging fluidization is observed in the downer at larger valve opening or higher inlet gas velocity. Moreover, statistical hydrodynamic shows uniform lateral solids volume distributions in the riser and downer. Solids fluctuating energy spectrum is generated to explore the turbulent characteristics, a segment phenomenon is observed in the inertial sub-region. In addition, the deviation of scale index in the inertial region form the Kolmogorov -5/3 scaling law indicates the flow intermittency.

The design and engineering of these smart materials was achieved through the coupling of pDA-modified SiO2 surfaces with poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based SCH-imprinted layers that can change their physical conformation in response to heat. The TO-MIPs were finally synthesized by being coupled with Au nanoparticles (the sensitive light-heat converter) through an in situ reduction of metallic salts.

Although this process enables the engineering of complex fibrous structures; the inability to yield industrial scale production through existing ES techniques becomes a bottle-neck and critical feature. Furthermore, in several advanced engineering remits (such as healthcare) the role of fiber alignment, layering and morphology is also paramount. In this study the development of a enhanced spinneret device for the up-scaled production of aligned fibers is demonstrated. Compared to conventional centrifugal electrospinning (CES,) techniques, a relatively greater production rate of fibers is achieved at reduced rotation speeds and also excludes the use of needles during the process. The impact of experimental process parameters such as rotation speed (60-90 rpm), working distance (9-14 cm) and solution concentration (15-30 w/v%) on resulting fiber properties were investigated using commercial polymeric drug delivery excipient polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Mass production of fibers is demonstrated and the impact of specifically aligned ultrafine drug-fiber matrices on drug release behavior is shown. For this, the antibiotic tetracycline hydrogen chloride was spun alongside PVP (5 w/w%) as the matrix material. The spinneret device provides an enhanced approach for active embedded fiber production on a scale favorable to industry (120 g/h) when using optimized process parameters (70 rpm and 15 kV for the four-pore system).

Glucose and graphite rod with stacked graphite granules were used as the substrate and electrode, respectively since they improved current density of MFC5 system and increased cathodic H2O2 synthesis. Both batch and continuous flow modes of MFCs were compared and the operational parameters for higher H2O2 yield were also studied. The results showed that for both batch and continuous flow modes, initially the H2O2 production had a rising trend and arrived at the highest level but subsequently it decreased. We later demonstrated that controlling pH at 3 would promote H2O2 accumulation.

The inhibition ratio of the fluoride on struvite crystallization remarkably increased with an increase in the fluoride concentration and a drop in the pH value. The optimal pH for struvite precipitation in the semiconductor wastewater was taken as 9.5, the value at which the fluoride effect significantly decreased. Therefore, to further lower the fluoride effect, an overdose of the magnesium source was required in the process of struvite precipitation. The experimental results thus indicated that overdosing the bittern was the more effective method to treat the semiconductor wastewater compared with a brucite overdose; this was because large amounts of un-reacted brucite remained in the solution, causing increased costs and operation difficulty when it was employed as magnesium source.

The influence of ammonia and hydrogen pressures was investigated. It was found that ammonia pressure did not influence the reaction, while extra hydrogen in the reaction mixture was beneficial for dodecanol conversion and dodecylamine selectivity. A dodecylamine yield of 83.8% was achieved with RuiC catalyst at 150 degrees C, 4 bar ammonia and 2 bar hydrogen after 24 h reaction. Zero reaction order in ammonia typically implies that the rate limiting step is not related to amination, but rather to a preceding dehydrogenation step. Experimentally observed unusual positive order in hydrogen in dehydrogenation was related to deactivation by surface coking. Partial surface regeneration requires presence of hydrogen, thus explaining a positive reaction order towards this reactant. A detailed analysis of kinetic regularities, which due to specificity of the reaction mechanism could be done separately for activity and selectivity, allowed advancing a mathematical model adequately describing experimental observations.

The results indicated that a lower pH would result in a greater increase in the BDE209 removal efficiency, and the maximum removal efficiency was obtained at pH = 3.0. The effects of sodium persulfate (PS) dosage and molar ratio of PS/Fe(II) were also determined, and 0.2 mol L-1 and 2:1 were the best conditions, where the removal of BDE209 in soil could reach to about 53% after 6 h. Additionally, hydroxylamine (HA) was firstly introduced to a PS/Fe(II) system, and resulted in a large enhancement of BDE209 removal efficiency. Compared to the controls, the degradation rate increased by 13% with the ratio of HA/Fe(II) 4/1, which might be because HA accelerated the transformation from Fe(III) to Fe(lI).

With the introduction of two active metal oxides (i.e. manganese and cerium oxides) at various loadings on Fe-MCM-41, the elimination of oxalic acid was increased to 83% from its initial concentration. The catalytic activity was found to strongly depend on the proportions of the active compounds. Cerium oxide was more effective active compound than manganese oxides because it led to higher degradation efficiency of oxalic acid. The iron content and the proportions of the metal oxides loadings were optimized. The application of optimum catalyst formulation (0.75 wt% manganese oxides and 1.19 wt% cerium oxide on Fe-MCM-41 with 1 wt% iron content) in the presence of ozone was found to be remarkably promising in degradation of oxalic acid. The optimum supported catalyst could practically remove 94% of the oxalic acid. It was observed that the higher adsorption of oxalic acid on the catalyst samples, the higher elimination of oxalic acid by catalytic ozonation. Therefore, it was deduced that the adsorption of oxalic acid influenced the catalytic activity of the supported catalysts. It is believed that the oxidation of adsorbed organic pollutant on the surface predominantly occurred during the catalytic ozonation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Three main parameters were studied: initial toluene concentration, light irradiance and air stream velocity. The experimental results were used to calculate the single-pass removal efficiency for different operating conditions and to establish a relationship between the single-pass removal efficiency, light irradiance and air stream velocity.

The results showed that at pilot scale, adding a small amount of water vapor in air enhances the processes performance and 10% increase in Buty removal efficiency was observed. A kinetic degradation model was also proposed, which takes into account the relative humidity influence. Active species due to water dissociation are integrated in the model. To represent the chemical degradation pathway, we supposed, in a first step, that an equivalent intermediate compound (EI) is formed directly from Buty. Then, in a second step, this EI is oxidized by active species into CO2 and CO in the discharge zone.

In this study, an AC gliding arc discharge (GAD) reactor has been developed for the conversion of toluene as a tar model compound using nitrogen as a carrier gas. The presence of steam in the plasma reaction produces OH radicals which open a new reaction route for the conversion of toluene through a stepwise oxidation of toluene and intermediates, resulting in a significant enhancement in both the conversion of toluene and the energy efficiency of the plasma process. The effects of steam-to-carbon (S/C) molar ratio, toluene feed rate and specific energy input (SEI) on the performance of the plasma steam reforming of toluene have been investigated. The optimal S/C molar ratio was found to be between 2 and 3 for high toluene conversion and energy efficiency. The maximum toluene conversion of 51.8% was achieved at an optimal S/C molar ratio of 2, a toluene feed flow rate of 4.8 ml/h and a SEI of 0.3 kWh/m(3), while the energy efficiency of the plasma process reached a maximum (similar to 46.3 g/kWh) at a toluene feed flow rate of 9.6 ml/h and a SEI of 0.19 kWh/m(3).

The polyHIPE monoliths were produced from a light induced polymerization of an ionomer, namely sulfonated polystyrene stabilized high internal phase emulsions (SPS-HIPEs). The SPS-HIPEs consisted of seawater as the dispersed aqueous phase and inexpensive monomers such as butyl acrylate and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the continuous phase. Sulfonated polystyrene was from used foams, realizing a sustainable transformation of waste polystyrene. PolyHIPE monoliths from SPS-HIPEs (SPS-polyHIPEs) reached a high gel fraction of 93% with exposure to UV light for only 5 min, providing a possibility to produce them continuously. SPS-polyHIPEs are much greener in comparison to those from surfactant- or particles-stabilized HIPEs, and no purification is required prior to use. SPS-polyHIPE monoliths exhibit interconnected macro-porous structures, and the sizes of pores as well as pore throats can be controlled simply by the volume fraction of the dispersed phase. These monoliths are hydrophobic with a water contact angle over 140 degrees. Excellent performances have been verified for oil spill reclamation, including high absorption capacity to a series of organic solvents or oils, high absorption rate of reaching saturated absorption in 3-5 min, a high recovery rate over 85% and a high reusability over 20 times.

BEA type zeolites, with high content of Lewis and Bronsted sites, promoted the catalytic D4 ring-opening leading on the formation of smaller alpha-omega-silanediols, which are narrower molecules able to diffuse into the channel system. Wet oxidation processes were used for the regeneration of a spent BEA zeolite, including ozonation and Fenton-like treatment. Both treatments were optimized to recover almost completely the D4 uptake of the iron-exchanged Fe-BEA in the first use. Thus, its feasibility to be reused was evaluated in successive adsorption/oxidation cycles, recovering up to 80% in at least three subsequent steps. However, in further cycles the accumulation of D4 and/or by-products led to a successive decline in the catalytic activity of the zeolites, hampering not only the capacity to transform D4 into lineal silanediols, thus reducing the adsorption capacity, but also the catalytic activity towards promoting Fenton-like reactions during regeneration.

Crosslinkers with two amine-reactive groups such as epoxy and halide were used to prepare crosslinked polyethyleneimine (PEI)-impregnated sorbents. A viscosity increase was observed in all crosslinked PEIs. The structure and the amine ratio of the crosslinked PEIs were investigated by C-13 NMR analysis.

The findings suggest that the invasive nature of SpaciMS depends on its configuration and application. Using monoliths with a range of cell densities (100-600 cells per square inch, CPSI), the concentration profiles of propylene sampled with probes of two different outer diameters (170 and 363 mu m) are compared with the temperature measured using coherent optical frequency domain reflectometry (c-OFDR). The comparison indicates that flow blockage has a negligible effect if the limiting propylene is depleted in the downstream reactor section. Suction by the probe compensates for the blockage for certain combinations of the channel diameter and probe size. In such cases the profile measured by a probe with the larger outer diameter (363 m) is similar to that measured by a smaller capillary (170 m). The experiments reveal that the axial position of the probe does not influence the flow profile in a 100 CPSI monolith channel, nor does it affect the amount of flow deflected to surrounding channels for a 600 CPSI monolith. Under some conditions the results are impacted by transverse concentration gradients. Their existence complicates the interpretation of the SpaciMS data. The difference between the location of propylene depletion and temperature maximum provides a useful metric for capturing the collective impacts of flow deflection and transverse gradients. The complexity of the flow, transport and reaction suggests that at least three dimensionless groups are needed to bound the operating regions in which the presence of the probe has minimal impact on the measured concentration.

The transportation of photogenerated electron and the depression of electron-hole pairs recombination were improved by the co-doping of GO and F in TiO2.

The influence of cationic monomer concentration, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were studied for the synthesis based on total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals from the POME. The recommended reaction conditions removed 87 and 52% of TSS and COD, respectively: 19 x 10(-3) mol of CHPTAC, 6 x 10(-2) mol of NaOH, 50 degrees C, and 5 h. C obtusifolia seed gum exhibited enhanced viscosity, higher magnitude of zeta potential (+6.41 mV) and changes in composition, thermal behaviour, and surface morphology after undergoing successful etherification process. Furthermore, the changes in properties led to its superior effectiveness as compared to its natural form in treatment of POME. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, an efficient approach to reduce the capital costs for the production of bio-based products is the use of high glucan loading. Therefore, in this study, a comparison of SSF strategies were investigated aiming to enhance ethanol production from acidic-alkaline pretreated cashew apple bagasse (CAB-OH) by Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC36907 at high glucan loading. An ethanol concentration of 58 g/L was achieved with 15% CAB-OH using batch SSF, resulting in an 81.2% overall ethanol yield. Prehydrolysis of 12 h, prior to SSF, did not significantly increase the overall ethanol yield. Fed-batch SSF, using high loadings of solids, was also investigated. Ethanol concentrations of up to 67 g/L could be produced from CAB-OH (20% w/v) by adding fresh substrate every 4 h during the first 48 h of SSF (10% initial and 2.5% of feeding), achieving an overall ethanol yield of 81%. In the fed-batch mode, the amount of enzyme was lower than used in batch and this process allowed higher ethanol concentrations and similar yield. No major differences in fed-batch performance, considering ethanol concentration and yield, were observed for the different feeding amounts, around 68 g/L and 80.7%, respectively.

These catalysts suffer a severe catalyst deactivation by coke, which has been characterized quantitatively and qualitatively by TG-TPO, MS/FTIR-TPO, FEIR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies. The first part of this work delves with the product distribution and deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite based catalyst during the transformation of (pure) aqueous glycerol. The second section focuses on the product distribution and deactivation of HY zeolite based catalyst during the joint cracking of vacuum-gas-oil (VGO) with aqueous glycerol. The results show that the mechanism of deactivation during glycerol cracking, independently of the catalyst used, involves two sequential steps: (i) condensation in the exterior of the zeolite to form an oxygenated coke and (ii) dehydration and hydrogen transfer of the previous oxygenated coke to form a more aromatic one. The second step is only activated at severer conditions (t > 3 s and T > 450 degrees C). Co-feeding glycerol with VGO increase the yield of coke, gases and decrease the yield of gasoline (with higher octane number), while VGO only participates in the formation of aromatic coke.

The morphology of synthesized materials was validated by SEM, whereas the crystal details were evaluated by XRD and TEM. Diffuse reflectance was measured to determine the band gap and analyse the absorption range of light by synthesized composites. The effect of morphology was examined by comparing the photocatalytic activity of nanorods with combustion synthesized ZnO nanoparticles. High aspect ratio, the presence of maximum number of charge carriers at the surface, dimensional anisotropy, ease in charge transfer through uni-direction of nanorods resulted in decreased recombination and high charge separation. This was found to be the reason of augmented photoactivity of nanorods over combustion synthesized nanoparticles. Absorption of light was increased by decorating CdS as a photosensitizer on ZnO surface. Enhanced photocatalysis was achieved by impregnation of 1% Ag on the surface of ZnO-CdS. First order kinetics was observed for all the reactions. The rate constant for inactivation reaction in presence of ZnO (NR)-CdS-Ag was 11 +/- 0.3 and 12 +/- 0.6 h(-1) in UV and visible light, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These carbamoyl acids are innovative chemicals that demonstrate their potential to bind metallic ions as Pb2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+ under specific physicochemical conditions (pH solution and metal-ligand relationship). The amide substituent in each compound induced a specific affinity toward the metallic ions contained in water, and it was studied by measuring zeta potential of an inert surface in contact with the aqueous media. This measurement allowed us to determine the association constants (K-f) with metal ions after defining the stronger interaction between the carbamoyl acids and metallic cations.

In this work, porous carbon beads (PCBs) of around 1.5 mm were synthesized via phase inversion route followed by carbonization. Specially, porous polymeric beads (PPBs) were obtained by injecting of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer solution containing phenolic resins into coagulation bath. The porous structure of PPBs can be adjusted by simply altering the composition of coagulation bath, which further determined the final microstructure of PCBs. Mercury porosimeter, SEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization revealed that the resultant PCBs possess uniform spherical shape, abundant macrospore and high mesoporosity. The sample obtained under the moderate phase inversion condition, i.e. PCBs-2, possesses highest BET surface area (1166 m(2)/g), mesoporous pore volume (0.249 cm(3)/g) and pore size (2.87 nm). To present the removal performance of PCBs for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the adsorption behaviors under static and dynamic conditions were investigated. The static adsorption result indicated that PCBs-2 exhibits the largest adsorption capacities for benzene (1.467 g/g), toluene (1.229 g/g), n-hexane (0.600 g/g) and acetone (0.770 g/g). Dynamic adsorption on thermogravimetric analyzer reveled that PCBs-2 presents higher adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics for benzene vapor. Breakthrough curves obtained from fixed bed on PCBs-2 and commercialized granular activated carbon further confirms the enhanced adsorption capacity was achieved on PCBs-2. After 6 adsorption-desorption cycles, the steady dynamic adsorption capacity can be reserved with negligible change.

Optimal parameters were identified as an HNO3 electrolyte concentration of 0.200 mol/L in the anode chamber; NaNO3 electrolyte concentrations of 0.800 mol/L in the heavy-metals and cathode chambers; and a current density of 2.0 mA/cm(2). Adjustment of the sludge pH to 3.8 before treatment clearly increased the current efficiency (CE) and decreased the specific energy consumption (SEC) of the process. Under the optimal conditions in EK systems equipped with two and three sludge chambers, the removal efficiencies for copper and nickel were 51.5-82.9% and 46.6-75.1%, respectively, after 132 h. The results of a sequential extraction procedure revealed that the binding states of the metals in the sludge were changed from difficult-to-extract to more easily extractable states after the EK process. Energy consumption calculations showed that the CE increased to 137.8% and the SEC decreased to 2.39 kWh/kg of metals removed when three sludge chambers were equipped in the EK system.

However, PLLA is intrinsically difficult to be produced for low-density and high porosity by physical foaming procedure, due to its weak melt strength, slow crystallization, kinetic, and low heterogeneous nucleation efficiency in bulk. For the sake of enhancing the PLLA's crystallization and heterogeneous nucleation in supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) foaming, a pressure-induced flow (PIF) method was applied on neat PLLA. As a result, the PLLA's crystallinity and its spherulite size increased from original 15.3% and 5.0 nm to 42.1% and 28.5 nm, respectively. High-strength and low-density PLLA foams with uniform and controlled cellular morphology were feasibly produced, varying the foaming temperature from 100 to 140 degrees C in a ScCO2 batch foaming process. The closed cellular structure was transformed to high interconnected porous structure, when reducing the foaming temperature. The open-cellular PLLA scaffolds foams, with a relatively high open pore content of 77.3%, prepared using this approach can achieve a high porosity up to 92.5%, and exhibit excellent compressive stress. To evaluate its tissue engineering application, long-term culture of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) demonstrated that the selected open-cellular PLLA scaffold provided prominent advantages ranging from enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation to facilitated nutrient transport. The combination of PIF and CO2 foaming process can produce a great promising PLLA scaffold for tissue engineering with desirable open-cellular structure, high-strength, low-cost and easy production capacity.

The ability of the device to examine the full range of flow rate ratio for the two phases while controlling the relative thicknesses of the phase layers is applied to surveying absorption performance over a wide range of DEA concentration at 312 K and 1.8 bara. Comparisons are made for a fixed 86 mu m liquid layer thickness, which is shown to fix also the fraction of the liquid accessible by diffusion, while maintaining 90% removal of CO2 from a gas stream of 10% (mole) CO2 in nitrogen. The increasing liquid viscosity with DEA fraction is countered by reducing the liquid flow rate to maintain constant liquid layer thickness and diffusion depth. The allowed gas throughput, while meeting 90% removal, increases with DEA concentration until the increasing viscosity gives sufficient reduction in liquid flow rate to offset the increasing CO2 capacity of the liquid. The maximum gas flow rate has a broad peak centred at a DEA mole fraction of about 0.072 (31% by mass). Utilisation of the amine is increased as DEA concentration increases, apparently as a result of the longer residence time, suggesting an effect of chemical time scales on the order of seconds. For a fixed concentration, full utilisation of the amine is achieved by decreasing the liquid flow rate, which reduces layer thickness and increases diffusion time.

Herein, we report its sorptive removal mechanism against metal organic frameworks (MOFs: UiO-66, UiO-66(NH2), ZIF-67, MOF-199, MOF-5, and MIL-101(Fe)) under ambient conditions. Their interactions were assessed by the Henry's law constant (K-H) and the heat of adsorption (Delta H-ads). Although the equilibrated adsorption capacities of all MOFs were measured from 159 (MOF-199) to 252 mg g(-1) (UiO-66(NH2)), those values were reduced considerably with increases in humidity and temperature. Among them, the sorption pattern of UiO-66(NH2) was the most reproducible when tested over a three cycle (147 (1st) and 133 mg g(-1) (3rd cycle)). The behavior of -NH terminated MOFs (UiO-66(NH2) and ZIF-67) was distinguished with those of -COOH as explained by a scheme of hypothetical potential energy profiles using mass transfer resistance and surface barrier phenomena.

For this purpose, the surface of magnetic nanoparticles was first coated with 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (MPS) by a silanization reaction to introduce reactive methacrylate groups onto the surface. Subsequently, monomers were grafted onto the surface of modified-MPS particles via two polymerization methods: seed emulsion (GMA, divinylbenzene, DVB, and styrene, S) and distillation - precipitation (GMA and DVB). The obtained nanocomposite particles were characterized by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), DR UV-Vis (diffuse reflectance ultraviolet - visible spectroscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy) combined with EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis and DLS (dynamic light scattering). FTIR spectroscopy showed that indeed a polymer - Fe3O4@MPS composite was obtained. TEM and EDS analysis showed that the seed emulsion method resulted in nanosized, 100 nm Fe3O4@MPS core/polymer shell NPs, forming long chains.

The size of the GbV-NP (277.4 +/- 1.4 nm) was smaller than that of LBL-GbV-NP (710.2 +/- 4.6 nm) but both had a spherical shape. These coated materials showed no cytotoxicity and facilitated better cell proliferation by osteoblast-like cells compared to the bare Ti. This was probably due to the roughness of the coated NP that enhanced cell attachement to the surface. Both coated materials showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus. The release of Van from GbV-NP was higher from LBL-GbV-NP and this corresponded to their antibacterial activity. Furthermore the release profile of Van showed a sustained release.

A plastic zone is formed around underground opening as a result of high induced stress magnitudes. The ground response curve is one of the best methods to investigate the tunnel stability that represent the relationship between the decreasing of inner pressure and the increasing of radial displacement of tunnel wall. In recent years, several methods have been suggested for analysis of ground response curve by many researchers, however, some of the analytical solutions that have been presented, are relevant to elastic-perfectly plastic or elastic-brittle-plastic behaviour of rock. But real behaviour of plastic zone is strain softening with variable dilatancy. In this study, it is attempted to take into account the post-peak rock mass behaviour (drop modulus and variable dilation angle) in the stress-based finite difference approximation numerical procedure, so an algorithm is suggested to analyse the tunnel stresses and convergences. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, the results were compared with FLAC numerical solution. For showing the applicability of the proposed algorithm, the Ghomroud tunnel convergence was calculated based on the proposed algorithm and compared with the monitored tunnel convergence. At the end, the effect of various parameters including dilation, critical softening parameter and rock mass quality (GSI) was studied on the tunnel convergence and plastic zone thickness. Based on the obtained results, the higher quality of the rock mass surrounding the tunnel has, the narrower plastic zone forms and the lower tunnel wall converges. Also, the rock mass with higher brittleness means more convergence and wider plastic zone. Furthermore, constant dilation in plastic zone overestimates the tunnel wall convergence.",2018,21,23,EC2HA,2018/8/10

Test mass is defined as a stationary mass, which is located in different places of the beam modelled by Timoshenko beam theory. The beam with an arbitrary number of cracks is modelled as segments connected by elastic springs illustrating open edge cracked cross-sectional flexibilities. The stiffness of the springs is determined using fracture mechanics theory. Solving the differential equations, the eigenfunctions of the problem are explicitly derived. Rayleigh's quotient method is then used to consider the effect of the test mass. Consequently, natural frequencies of the cracked beam with a test mass are derived for each mode of transverse vibration. Knowing the natural frequencies of the beam carrying a test mass at some different locations, it is possible to identify cracks' parameters (i.e. location and depth) by solving the system of equations. The proposed closed-form approach is also validated using numerical studies on multiple-cracked beam examples.

Repair of such pavements relies mainly on overlaying with additional SCC or asphalt concrete layers without accounting for possible strength and durability recovery by the mechanism known by self-healing. Would the latter be considered in repair plans, the problems associated with rigid pavements deterioration can be solved with the lowest possible cost. The present study aims at investigating the potential of self-healing and possible recovery of mechanical properties and durability of SCC considering key parameters, stress level at loading, loading age, and curing regime (water, air) and time period. For that, standard SCC cylinders (150x300mm) were cast from one SCC mixture, prepared at a w/c ratio of .45, cured for different periods in water, then subjected to varying compressive stress levels ranging from 80 to 100% of their ultimate load capacity, before re-cured in water or air for additional time periods, and finally tested for ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and compressive mechanical response. The damage index for SCC, in terms of UPV, showed slight increases for stress level of up to 95%, before sharply increased when SCC was fully damaged. SCC cured for higher time periods, prior to loading to stresses of up to 95%, received more internal damage, yet the impact of loading age on internal damage became minimal for fully crushed SCC specimens. Re-curing in water contributed more than in air to cracks' filling and mechanical behaviour recovery. SCC specimens stressed to levels of 90% or less then re-cured were able to regain their original mechanical characteristics, whereas those loaded to stress levels of 95% then re-cured lost tangible portions of their mechanical properties. As may be expected, fully damaged then re-cured SCC lost major portions of their mechanical properties; reaching as high 85%. Empirical models, developed in this work, showed that there exists a very good correlation between residual mechanical properties and a certain recovery index, defined in terms of damage indexes at loading and after re-curing.",2018,21,15,EC2HA,2018/8/13

Experimental data of complex modulus, |G(*)|, and phase angle, , are used to validate the proposed constitutive model. Based on the proposed extension of a fractional model, complex modulus isotherms for a range of frequencies can be created simply starting from isochronals at frequency value of 1Hz. Furthermore, a mathematical procedure derived from the same model is proposed in order to compute the shift factors and automatically create the master curve, thus avoiding further errors due to manual adjustments. This shifting procedure requires only a few isotherms to create a smooth master curve able to describe asphalt binder behaviour under a wide range of temperature and loading conditions. When the fractional model is adopted and the mathematical shifting procedure is applied, only a temperature sweep test at 1Hz is needed in order to create complex modulus and phase angle master curves.",2018,21,16,EC2HA,2018/8/14

Three longitudinal girder vibration amplitudes were selected to illustrate their effect on cable non-linear response under primary and sub-harmonic resonance. The numerical results show that partially releasing the longitudinal constraint between the girder and pylons ensures that longitudinal girder vibration eases cable vibrations. This provides scientific basis for designing cable-stayed bridge as floating or half-floating system from a non-linear vibrations of view.

Experiments were performed on a local natural clayey soil in order to investigate the influence of lime on consistency limits, total specific surface, compaction characteristics, swelling potential and swelling pressure. In addition, mercury intrusion porosimetry tests were carried out to determine the pore size distribution of the untreated and treated samples. The results show that the liquid limit decreases, the plastic limit increases and the total specific surface area decreases with the percentage of added lime. Compaction characteristics are affected by the addition of lime, the optimum water content increasing and the maximum dry unit weight decreasing in the presence of a high amount of lime.

Our previous studies show that osteogenic differentiation is strongly correlated with magnetic strength from hypo (500 nT), weak (geomagnetic field, GMF), moderate (0.2 T) to high (16 T) SMFs. We speculated that the intensity that had positive (16 T) or negative (500 nT and 0.2 T) effects on osteoblast differentiation would inversely influence osteoclast differentiation. To answer this question, we examined the profound effects of SMFs on osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells. Here, we demonstrated that 500 nT and 0.2 T SMFs promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation and resorption, while 16 T had an inhibitory effect. Almost all the osteoclastogenic genes were highly expressed under 500 nT and 0.2 T, including RANK, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), V-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase II (Car2) and cathepsin K (CTSK), whereas they were decreased under 16 T. In addition, 16 T disrupted actin formation with remarkably decreased integrin 3 expression.

Participants were recruited through flyers, partner agencies and peer researcher networks. Most interviews (21) were conducted in a language other than English. Interviews were transcribed, translated as appropriate and analyzed using NVivo software. The project followed a community-based participatory action research model.Results. Under/unemployment negatively impacted the physical and mental health of participants and their families. It did so directly, for example through social isolation, as well as indirectly through representation in poor quality jobs. Under/unemployment additionally led to the intensification of job search strategies and of the household/caregiving workload which also negatively impacted health. Health problems, in turn, contributed to pushing participants into long-term substandard employment trajectories. Participants' experiences were heavily structured by their social location as low income racialized immigrant women.Conclusions. Our study provides needed qualitative evidence on the gendered and racialized dimensions of under/unemployment, and adverse health impacts resulting from this.

The tripartite model of racism includes personally mediated racism, institutionalized racism, and the less-oft studied internalized racism. Internalized racism - or negative beliefs about one's racial group - results from cultural racism that is endemic in American society. In this project, we studied whether these negative stereotypes are associated with mental health among African-Americans and Caribbean Blacks.Design. Using secondary data from the National Survey of American Life, we investigated the association between internalized racism and mental health (measured by depressive symptoms and serious psychological distress (SPD)) among these two groups. We also explored whether ethnicity/nativity and mastery moderate the association between internalized racism and mental health among African-Americans and Caribbean Blacks.Results. Internalized racism was positively associated with depressive symptoms and SPD among all Black subgroups. However, internalized racism was a weaker predictor of SPD among foreign-born Caribbean Blacks than US-born Caribbean Blacks and US-born African-Americans. Additionally, higher mastery was protective against distress associated with internalized racism.Conclusion. Internalized racism is an important yet understudied determinant of mental health among Blacks.

Methods: Neutrophil CD64 Index, PCT, IL-6 and CRP levels were determined in 356 febrile patients in the hematology ward from May 2013 to May 2015. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) areas under the curve (AUC), and logistic regression analysis were determined to evaluate the diagnostic values of these biomarkers. Results: The levels of the four biomarkers were higher in the infection patients (p < 0.001), and the PCT and IL-6 were higher in the patients with positive microbial blood culture (p < 0.01). The neutrophil CD64 Index, PCT, IL-6, CRP had AUCs of 0.95, 0.83, 0.75 and 0.73, respectively.

One of the two advised tests is the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT). However, it is currently not clear whether all dRVVT reagents may be considered equivalent. The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of two dRVVT reagents, with special attention to the influence of anticoagulant therapy. Methods: STA (R)-Staclot (R) dRVV Screen/Confirm (Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and dRVT-LS/dRVTL-LR (Haematex, Hornsby, Australia) were evaluated on 443 patient samples [358 consecutive patients with LAC request including six antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients, 18 non-consecutively selected APS patients and 37 vitamin K antagonists (VKA)-treated and 30 direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)-treated non-APS patients]. Additionally, pooled normal plasma (PNP) was spiked with factor deficient plasma (n = 33) and DOAC calibrators (n = 21) to evaluate sensitivity for factor deficiencies and false-positivity rates, respectively. Results: A higher number of samples were defined as LAC positive by Stago vs. Haematex [11.5% (41/358) vs. 3.63% (13/358)]. Most discordances were in the VKA and DOAC group. Haematex was less prone to VKA-related factor deficiencies, explaining the absence of false-positive LAC results in VKA-treated non-APS patients compared to 10.8% with Stago. We observed no false-positive LAC ratios with Haematex in DOAC-spiked PNP and a lower number in DOAC-treated non-APS patients. However, increased specificity seemed to be at cost of a reduced sensitivity as Haematex showed less positive APS patient samples (45.8% vs. 87.5%).

Continuous percentile charts from birth to adulthood allow accurate consideration of these dynamics and seem reasonable for an analyte as closely linked to growth as alkaline phosphatase. However, the ethical and practical challenges unique to pediatric reference intervals have restricted the creation of such percentile charts, resulting in limitations when clinical decisions are based on alkaline phosphatase activity. Methods: We applied an indirect method to generate percentile charts for alkaline phosphatase activity using clinical laboratory data collected during the clinical care of patients. A total of 361,405 samples from 124,440 patients from six German tertiary care centers and one German laboratory service provider measured between January 2004 and June 2015 were analyzed. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity was performed on Roche Cobas analyzers using the IFCC's photometric method. Results: We created percentile charts for alkaline phosphatase activity in girls and boys from birth to 18 years which can be used as reference intervals. Additionally, data tables of age- and sex-specific percentile values allow the incorporation of these results into laboratory information systems. Conclusions: The percentile charts provided enable the appropriate differential diagnosis of changes in alkaline phosphatase activity due to disease and changes due to physiological development.

We present experiments and numerical simulations of the dip-coating and self-metered die-coating of compact, geometrically convex patterns such as squares and diamonds. The coating of such patterns is intrinsically an instationary process. Nevertheless, the maximum film thickness entrained on diamonds that are either much smaller or larger than the lengthscale governing the coating process follows the theoretical predictions derived for steady-state coating of either narrow hydrophilic stripes or chemically homogeneous surfaces. The transition between these two regimes is determined by the ratio of the pattern dimensions and the characteristic length of the reservoir meniscus, i.e. the capillary length for dip-coating and the die-gap for die-coating processes. While the film thickness entrained on diamonds scales with the coating speed as a powerlaw, the entrained thickness on squares with sides oriented parallel and perpendicular to the coating direction appears to saturate for small coating speeds. This influence of the azimuthal pattern orientation is related to the capillary break-up of the coating meniscus. Residual satellite droplets observed underneath the hydrophilic patterns after coating are a consequence either of the break-up or the subsequent retraction of the coating meniscus.",2018,158,9,ED7SA,2018/8/25

Areas covered: Polymer-based nanocarriers have been extensively studied to maximize cancer treatment efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of standard therapeutics. Regarding diagnosis, nano-materials like quantum dots, iron oxide nanoparticles or gold nanoparticles have been developed to provide rapid, sensitive detection of cancer and, therefore, facilitate early treatment and monitoring of the disease. Therefore, multifunctional nanosystems with both imaging and therapy functionalities bring us a step closer to delivering precision/personalized medicine in the cancer setting. Expert opinion: There are multiple barriers for these new nanosystems to enter the clinic, but it is expected that in the near future, nanocarriers, together with new 'targeted drugs', could replace our current treatments and cancer could become a nonfatal disease with good recovery rates.

Tissues were profiled by qPCR of 32 genes to study responses to copepodids, 4 days post infection (dpi), and during the moult of copepodids to the chalimus stage, at 8 dpi. Basal/constitutive differences were found for many immune-related genes between the two skin sites; e.g., mannose binding protein C was over 100 fold higher expressed in the scaled skin from the back in comparison to the skin without scales from the head. With lice-infection, at 4 dpi most genes in both tissues showed lower values than in the non-infected control. By 8 dpi, the majority of responses increased towards the control levels, including cytokines of Th1, Th17 and Th2 pathways. Immunohistochemistry of three immune factors revealed an even distribution of MHC class II positive cells throughout epidermis, including the top layer of keratinocytes, marked compartmentalization of Mx(+) and CD alpha(+) cells close to stratum basale, and an increase in numbers of CD8 alpha(+) cells in response to infection. In conclusion, suppression of immune genes during the copepodid stage likely sets off a beneficial situation for the parasite. At the moult to chalimus stage 8 dpi, only few genes surpassed the non-infected control levels, including CD8 alpha. The gene expression pattern was reflected in the increased number of CD8 alpha expressing cells, thus revealing a relatively minor activation of skin T-cell defenses in Atlantic salmon in response to L. salmonis infection.

But, a puzzling question remains to be answered, as to how intronless type I IFN genes in amniotes might have evolved from intron-containing type I IFN genes in fish and amphibians. In this study, intronless and intron-containing type I IFNs were found in the amphibian model, Xenopus tropicalis, with a total of sixteen and five genes, respectively. The intronless IFNs can be divided into three subgroups, and the intron-containing ones into two subgroups, implying that a retroposition event might have occurred in amphibians, resulting in the generation of intronless type I IFN genes. Two models were tentatively proposed to explain the evolution of type I IFNs in vertebrates: in model A, fish should possess the most primitive multi-exon-containing type I IFNs, and intronless type I IFN genes in amphibians are the ancestor of modern intronless type I IFNs in amniotes; in model B, intronless type I IFN genes in X. tropicalis may just represent an independent bifurcation in this species or probably in amphibians, and intronless type I IFN genes in amniotes may have arisen from another retroposition event occurred in a transition period even when reptiles were diverged from amphibians. It is considered that the model B can reflect the current knowledge on the occurrence of intronless and intron-containing type I IFN genes in vertebrate lineages. This study thus contributes to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of type I IFNs in vertebrates, and of the occurrence of intronless I IFNs in higher vertebrates.

To explore its potential roles in crustaceans' immune responses we have identified and characterized LvPHB2, a 891 bp gene encoding a 297 amino acids protein in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Expression analyses showed that LvPHB2 is expressed in all examined tissues, and largely present in cytoplasm, correlating with its known anti-oxidation function in mitochondria. Luciferase reporter assays showed that over expression of LvPHB2 could activate the p53 pathway, indicating that it might participate in apoptosis regulation. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that infection with Vibrio alginolyticus induces its up regulation in hepatopancreas. Moreover, RNAi knock-down of LvPHB2 in vivo raises mortality rates of L. vannamei infected by V. alginolyticus, and affects expression of STAT3, Caspase3 and p53 genes. We found significantly higher reactive oxygen species production, DNA damage and apoptosis rates in LvPHB2-silenced shrimp challenged with V. alginolyticus than in controls injected with a Green Fluorescent Protein-silencing construct. Our results suggest that LvPHB2 plays a vital role in shrimp responses to V. alginolyticus infection through its participation in regulation of oxidants and apoptosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Burkholderia symbiont is orally acquired by host nymphs from the environment in every generation. However, it is still unclear how Riptortus specifically interacts with entomopathogens that are abundant in the environmental soil. In preliminary experiments, we observed that a potent entomopathogen, Serratia marcescens, can, colonize the midgut of Riptortus insects and was recovered from the midgut when Serratia cells were orally administered, suggesting that this pathogenic bacterium can escape host immune defenses in the salivary fluid. We examined how orally fed Serratia cells can survive in the presence of antimicrobial substances of the Riptortus salivary fluid. In this study, a 15 kDa trialysin-like protein from the salivary gland of R. pedestris and a potent virulence factor of Serratia cells, a serralysin metalloprotease, from the culture medium of S. marcescens were successfully purified to homogeneity. When the purified Riptortus trialysin (rip-trialysin) was incubated with purified serralysin, rip-trialysin was specifically hydrolyzed by serralysin, leading to the loss of antimicrobial activity. These results clearly demonstrated that a potent virulent metalloprotease of S. marcescens functions as a key player in the escape from the salivary fluid-mediated host immune response, resulting in successful colonization of S. marcescens in the host midgut.

Hereby, LGBP was cloned from Fenneropenaeus merguiensis hepatopancreas. Its full-length cDNA (1280 bp) had an open reading frame of 1101 bp, encoding a peptide of 366 amino acids. The LGBP primary structure comprises a recognition motif for beta-1,3-linkage of polysaccharides, two integrin binding motifs, a kinase C phosphorylation site and a bacterial glucanase motif. The LGBP mRNA was strongly expressed in hepatopancreas and significantly up-regulated to get the maximum at 12 h upon Vibrio harveyi challenge. Recombinant LGBP (rLGBP) could agglutinate Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including yeast with Ca2+-dependence. V harveyi agglutination induced by rLGBP was intensively inhibited by lipoteichoic acid, less in order were lipopolysaccharide, beta-1,3-glucan and N-acetyl neuraminic acid. Western blotting revealed that rLGBP bound widely to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and also yeast. By ELISA quantification, rLGBP could bind to beta-1,3-glucan better than to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. These findings suggest that LGBP may function as a receptor which recognizes invading diverse pathogens and contribute in F merguiensis immune response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These CNTs may alter the sediments' physicochemical properties and influence the transportation of coexisting contaminants because of the CNTs large specific surface area and high porosity. In this study, the influence of multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) on sediment pore surface properties, hydrophobicity and the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) adsorption behavior were investigated. Meanwhile, the role of the aging processes of MWCNTs was also explored as these processes may alter the effects of MWCNTs on sediment properties. The results showed that the average pore size, external surface area (S-ext), total surface area (S-BET), and hydrophobic property clearly increased because of the MWCNTs contamination which enhanced the SMX adsorption capacity. Meanwhile, the pi-pi electron coupling/stacking between SMX and graphene surface of MWCNTs may be another factor increasing the SMX adsorption capacity. MWCNTs filling the sediment micro-pores decreased the isotherm linearity parameter (n) indicating an increase in adsorption intensity and heterogeneity. It was also found that the effects of MWCNTs on sediment pore surface properties and SMX adsorption significantly reduced during the aging processes from 0 to 2 months and subsequently leveled off, while, the aging processes had no effects on the hydrophobic property of the contaminated sediments. Aging mechanisms of MWCNTs in sediments may be mainly the pore blockage, surface coverage, and competitive adsorption of the nature organic matter (NOM) transferred from the sediments. These results may contribute to modelling and predicting the potential environmental risk of MWCNTs in natural aquatic sediments, particularly considering the influence of the aging process.

Green tea has recently attracted significant attention due to its health benefits in a variety of disorders, ranging from cancer to weight loss. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of EMR (frequency 900 MHz modulated at 217 Hz, power density 0.02 mW/cm(2), SAR 1.245 W/kg) on different oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus and striatum of adult rats. This study also extends to evaluate the therapeutic effect of green tea mega EGCG on the previous parameters in animals exposed to EMR after and during EMR exposure. The experimental animals were divided into four groups: EMR-exposed animals, animals treated with green tea mega EGCG after 2 months of EMR exposure, animals treated with green tea mega EGCG during EMR exposure and control animals. EMR exposure resulted in oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum as evident from the disturbances in oxidant and antioxidant parameters. Co-administration of green tea mega EGCG at the beginning of EMR exposure for 2 and 3 months had more beneficial effect against EMR-induced oxidative stress than oral administration of green tea mega EGCG after 2 months of exposure. This recommends the use of green tea before any stressor to attenuate the state of oxidative stress and stimulate the antioxidant mechanism of the brain.",2018,36,11,EC3HG,2018/9/14

Injury to the spinal cord results in disruption of axonal transmission of signals. This primary trauma causes secondary injuries that produce immunological responses such as neuroinflammation, which perpetuates neurodegeneration and cytotoxicity within the injured spinal cord. To date there is no FDA-approved pharmacological agent to prevent the development of secondary SCI and induce regenerative processes aimed at healing the spinal cord and restoring neurological function. An alternative method to electrically activate spinal circuits is the application of a noninvasive electromagnetic field (EMF) over intact vertebrae. The EMF method of modulating molecular signaling of inflammatory cells emitted in the extra-low frequency range of <100 Hz, and field strengths of <5 mT, has been reported to decrease inflammatory markers in macrophages, and increase endogenous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and differentiation rates. EMF has been reported to promote osteogenesis by improving the effects of osteogenic media, and increasing the proliferation of osteoblasts, while inhibiting osteoclast formation and increasing bone matrix in vitro. EMF has also been shown to increase chondrogenic markers and collagen and induce neural differentiation, while increasing cell viability by over 50%. As advances are made in stem cell technologies, stabilizing the cell line after differentiation is crucial to SCI repair. Once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted, EMF may be applied outside the wound for potential continued adjunct treatment during recovery.",2018,36,14,EC3HG,2018/9/15

Among them, the simplest method requires a large enough computational domain to prevent or reduce numerical errors at the boundaries. However, an efficient method generally requires special treatment to overcome the problems raised by the outlet boundary condition used. For example, mass flux is not conserved and the fluid field is not divergence-free at the outlet boundary. Overcoming these problems requires additional computational cost. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient outflow boundary condition for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, aiming to reduce the computational domain for simulating flow inside a long channel in the streamwise direction. The proposed outflow boundary condition is based on the transparent equation, where a weak formulation is used. The pressure boundary condition is derived by using the Navier-Stokes equations and the outlet flow boundary condition. In the numerical algorithm, a staggered marker-and-cell grid is used and temporal discretization is based on a projection method. The intermediate velocity boundary condition is consistently adopted to handle the velocity-pressure coupling. Characteristic numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme. Furthermore, the agreement of computational results from small and large domains suggests that our proposed outflow boundary condition can significantly reduce computational domain sizes.",2018,11,17,ED1EC,2018/9/18

With respect to situations where the compact heat exchangers are partially installed inside a channel, such as the application of recuperators in an intercooled recuperative engine, the use of an isotropic porous medium model needs to be carefully assessed because the flow passing through the heat exchanger is very complicated. For this purpose, in this study the isotropic porous medium model is assessed together with specific pressure-velocity relationships for flow field modeling inside a rectangular channel with a built-in double-U-shaped tube bundle heat exchanger. Firstly, experiments were conducted using models to investigate the relationship between the pressure drop and the inlet velocity for a specific heat exchanger with different installation angles inside a rectangular channel. Secondly, a series of numerical computations were carried out using the isotropic porous medium model and the pressure-velocity relationship was then modified by introducing correction coefficients empirically. Finally, a three-dimensional (3-D) direct computation was made using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the comparison of detailed flow fields.

MR measurements of gas hold-up, bubble-size distribution, and bubble-rise velocities were made as a function of flow rate and packing size. Gas and liquid flow rates were studied in the range of 20-250 cm(3) s(-1) and 0-200 cm(3) min(-1), respectively. The gas hold-up within the beds was found to increase with gas flow rate, while decreasing with increasing packing size and to a lesser extent with increasing liquid flow rate. The gas hold-up can be separated into a dynamic gas hold-up, only weakly dependent on packing size and associated with bubbles rising up the bed, and a static hold-up which refers to locations within the bed associated with temporally-invariant gas hold-up, over the measurement times of 512 s, associated either with gas trapped within the void structure of the bed or with gas channels within the bed. This static gas hold-up is strongly dependent on packing size, showing an increase with decreasing packing size. The dynamic gas hold-up is comprised of small bubbles of order of the packing size which have rise velocities of 10-40 mm s(-1) and which move between the packing elements within the bed, along with much larger bubbles, or agglomerates of bubbles, which move with higher rise velocities (100-300 mm s(-1)). These larger bubbles, which may exist as streams of smaller bubbles or amoeboid bubbles, behave as a single large bubble in terms of the observed high rise velocity.

The design parameters include two phase pressure drop, mixing and axial mixing in both the phases, effective interfacial area, heat and mass transfer coefficients. Currently, there is a high degree of empiricism in the design process of such reactors owing to the complexity of coupled flow and reaction mechanism. Hence, we focus on synthesizing recent advances in computational and experimental techniques that will enable future designs of such reactors in a more rational manner by exploring a large design space with high-fidelity models (computational fluid dynamics) that are validated with high-fidelity measurements (hot film anemometry (HFA), Laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), particle image velocimetry (Ply), etc.) to provide a high degree of rigor. Understanding the spatial distributions of dispersed phases and their interaction during scale up are key challenges that were traditionally addressed through pilot scale experiments, but now can be addressed through advanced modelling. For practically complete knowledge of the fluid mechanical parameters, it is desirable to implement direct numerical simulations (DNS). However, the current computational power does not permit full DNS for real bubble columns. Therefore, we have been using simplified turbulence models (such as large eddy simulation, Reynolds stress, k-epsilon, etc.) which need the knowledge of turbulence parameters. For the estimation of these parameters, currently semi-empirical procedures are being used pending the knowledge of turbulence. Further, the formulation of governing equations in all the CFD models (except DNS), the knowledge of interface forces (drag, lift, virtual mass, Basset, etc.) is needed and for their estimations empirical correlations are being employed, again pending the knowledge of fluid mechanics under turbulent conditions in bubble columns. In gas liquid dispersions, the gas is sparged in the form of bubbles. During the bubble rise, the mechanism of wake detachment creates turbulence which can be called as wake generated turbulence. In addition, energy gets transferred from the gas phase to liquid phase. The quantitative amounts are negligible when bubble motion is not hindered and the gas liquid dispersion is homogenous. The amounts increase with an increase in the extent of hindrance. However, in the homogenous regime, even under extreme conditions, the extent of energy transfer in the bulk gas liquid dispersions (volume other than wake volume) is fairly limited. On contrast, in the heterogeneous regime, the rates of energy transfer become sizeable. The energy received by the liquid (in both the regimes) also creates turbulent motion and termed as bulk generated turbulence. In turbulent flows a compendium of eddies (flow structures) of different length and time scales contribute towards improved/enhanced mixing, momentum transfer, heat transfer, and mass transfer (transport phenomena). Hence, a proper understanding of the dynamics of these turbulent flow structures, and their role in the transport phenomena, can bring substantial improvement in the scale-up and design procedures. The present paper brings out the current status of knowledge on bubble generated turbulence. All the published literature in experimental measurements and DNS simulations has been critically analysed and coherently presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When designing these bubble columns it is important to be able to predict the conditions that mark the transition from homogeneous (bubbly) to heterogeneous (churn-turbulent) flow. The transition is a function of many variables, including: liquid and gas superficial velocities, bubble diameter, and liquid and gas physical properties. Linear stability analysis (LSA) has been successfully applied by many researchers to determine the gas volume fraction at which the instability takes place; and correspondingly a one dimensional stability factor, f(1), has been proposed (see for example Joshi et al. (2001)). Briefly, the LSA analysis utilises the velocity fluctuations of both the dispersed and continuous phases associated with the specific energy dissipation rate of the two phase mixture. Typically, the specific energy dissipation rate is correlated with the density of the bed. The previous analysis, however, does not consider the energy input which associated with the turbulence intensity (velocity fluctuations) of the incoming liquid stream. Usually, this component can be ignored in sparged bubble columns because its magnitude is relatively small and it also decays in the axial direction. In plunging liquid jet bubble columns the liquid is introduced as a high speed jet that entrains gas which is then broken into fine bubbles in the Mixing Zone. The bubby mixture then passes into the Two Phase Flow Zone where instabilities can be generated. The Mixing Zone is a region of high energy dissipation resulting in relatively large liquid velocity fluctuations, which can directly influence the instability of the Two Phase Flow Zone. In this study the existing linear stability analysis is modified to include the influence of inlet liquid velocity fluctuations on the stability parameter, f(1). The modified theory is applied to the previous work of Evans (1990) for a plunging liquid jet bubble column to determine the critical gas volume fraction at which transition takes place in the Two Phase Flow Zone. In order to apply the model, drift-flux analysis has been used to obtain bubble diameter as a function of gas and liquid superficial velocities, and computational fluid dynamics has been utilised to quantify the velocity fluctuations of the liquid exiting the Mixing Zone.

Experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm diameter column operating at pressures up to 6.5 MPa. A 0.5 wt% aqueous ethanol solution was used in this study to simulate high gas holdups observed in many industrial reactors containing liquid mixtures with surface-active compounds. The probe struggled to detect all the bubbles due to significant bubble size reduction and non-rectilinear bubble rise. However, successfully detected bubbles were deemed representative of the mean bubble rise velocity as indicated by the dynamic gas disengagement technique. Global gas holdup profiles in conjunction with the drift flux analysis showed that pressure does not have a significant impact at elevated liquid flow rates as bubbles tend to follow the convective current of the liquid. Relatively narrow chord length distributions were observed, where 90% of the bubbles were 1.0 mm or less. The energy dissipated through the gas liquid distributor plate was shown to have a significant impact on the initial bubble size generated and high gas holdups were also achieved at atmospheric pressure by varying the open-surface area of the distributor.

A single centrally placed electrical rod, designed to mimic the nuclear fuel rod has been used. The void fraction measurement is made using gamma ray densitometry technique. Axial and radial vapor void fractions have been reported, as a function of inlet liquid flux and inlet liquid temperature. The experimental data has been rationalized using a simple one-dimensional drift flux model adapted to the conditions of the experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome these limitations, new micro-structured bubble column reactor is proposed. In this reactor, a catalyst coated wire mesh is introduced in a bubble column to cut the bubbles and enhance the interface dynamics. In this work, the effect of the simplest form of a wire mesh, i.e. a single wire, on a single bubble is studied experimentally and using Direct Numerical Simulations. The combined Volume of Fluid and Immersed Boundary method shows a good agreement with the experimentally obtained bubble sizes after cutting, bubble shapes, trajectory and bubble rise velocities. Only small differences are found in the bubble rise velocity in close proximity of the wire. Various effects were determined both experimentally and numerically: the effects of Eotvos number, Morton number, bubble rise velocity, wire diameter and the obliqueness of the bubble wire interactions. From the results, it can be concluded that the main influences on the bubble cutting are the Eotvos number, the wire diameter and the obliqueness of the interaction. However, a quantitative closure for the bubble cutting using single wires could not be obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,157,9,ED4OG,2018/10/7

Simulations of bubbly flows up to industrial dimensions are feasible within the Eulerian two-fluid framework of interpenetrating continua. However, for practical applications suitable closure models are needed which describe the physics on the scale of individual bubbles or groups thereof. The quest for such models with a broad range of applicability allowing predictive simulations is an ongoing venture. A set of closure relations for the fluid dynamics of bubbly flow has been collected that represents the best available knowledge and may serve as a baseline for further improvements and extensions. It is shown that this model is applicable to bubbly flows in different systems, namely pipes, bubble columns, and airlift columns. While these systems have been considered individually before, the novelty of the present work lies in their unified treatment by a single model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of such gradients on the microbial metabolism can significantly compromise optimal bioreactor performance. Lapin et ai.

The discrete representation of the biomass phase yields an advantageous perspective for studying the impact of extra-cellular variations on the metabolism, but at significant computational cost. In particular, the tracked number of particles, as well as the applied time resolution, have a large impact on both the accuracy of the simulation and the runtime of the simulation.

In both reactors, the mass transfer coefficients were predicted successfully not only in the homogeneous regime but also in the heterogeneous regime (superficial gas velocities up to 0.08 ms(-1)). The results in the article demonstrate the importance of the geometrical characteristics (length and height) of the oblate ellipsoidal bubbles for the accurate calculation of the contact time and thus the volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient K(L)a. The gas-liquid interfacial area has been calculated in both reactors in the classical way, i.e. as a function of the gas holdup and inversely proportional to the Sauter-mean bubble diameter. It was found that in the gas-liquid bubble column (0.095 m in ID) the modified penetration theory was applicable to tap water, 9 organic liquids (decalin, nitrobenzene, 2-propanol, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol (99%), tetralin, xylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, ethylene glycol) and two liquid mixtures (water-glycol and tetralin-ethanol). Tetralin was aerated with both nitrogen and helium, whereas xylene was aerated with hydrogen and helium. The correction factor introduced by Calderbank (1967) was found useful for improving the kip predictions in 1,2-dichloroethane, ethanol (99%), xylene(-hydrogen) and toluene-ethanol 97.2%. In the case of a slurry bubble column, the new approach was found applicable (at low solids concentrations) to four different gas-liquid-solid systems: air-tetralin-Al2O3, air-water-Al2O3, air-water-activated carbon and air-Na2SO4-kieselguhr. It is noteworthy that in some cases (air-water-Al2O3) the new definition of the contact time was found applicable up to solids concentrations of 62.9%. In the case of a slurry bubble column, it was found that when the theoretical kip value is multiplied by the inverse value of the correction factor the predictions improve with about 5%. Finally, in the slurry bubble column the contact time was defined on the basis of the length of the micro eddies and the K(L)a values in both air-water-alumina and air-water-activated carbon systems were successfully predicted. This is also a potentially good approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,157,13,ED4OG,2018/10/10

Here we investigated a single CO2 bubble (2.9 mm in equivalent dia.) that ascended in a zigzag motion in purified water and in water contaminated with a very small amount of 1-pentanol. We used a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique and 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS), and we employed a pH-sensitive dye that was calibrated by means of a photoelectric optical fiber probe to visualize the bubble-to-liquid-phase mass transfer and the bubble's wake structure. Two high-speed cameras were used to capture the bubble wake (including the CO2 dissolution), the bubble motion, and the bubble wake from two orthogonal directions. Based on the visualization results, we obtained the volume, surface area, velocity, orientation angle and shape of the bubble from moment to moment. The instantaneous mass transfer coefficient of the bubble was precisely calculated from the above results. Due to reiteration of the adsorption and desorption of the surfactant on the bubble surface, the direction of the Marangoni convection was very difficult to identify. Here, based on our analysis of forces that were calculated from the bubble motion, we considered the direction of action of the Marangoni convection indirectly. On the basis of these experimental results, we discuss the influences of the bubble-surface contamination on the bubble motion and the mass transfer, as well as the bubble wake.

This multi-step water electrolysis system can achieve a high energy conversion efficiency during hydrogen production by reducing the ohmic overpotential between the electrodes through use of a thinner separator than that used in conventional systems. In the present study, manganese dioxide (MnO2) was selected as the intermediate electrode because its oxidation-reduction potential is located between the potentials of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In addition, the electrolysis cell contained using metal hydride and nickel hydroxide as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, to split the gas evolution reactions at the solid/liquid/gas three-phase boundary into reactions at the solid/gas and solid/liquid two-phase boundaries. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrolyzer cell was tested at 25, 40, and 60 degrees C and the results show that oxygen and hydrogen can be easily separated by producing them in different steps. Furthermore, a low average voltage for water electrolysis, below 1.6 V, was obtained at 60 degrees C.

The asymmetric feeding of solids can be caused by the designed-geometry of J-bend right before the riser inlet or unbalanced operation of wall-steam feeding. In order to ensure uniform distributions in local catalytic to oil ratio (CTO) and temperature, a possible measure of matching the asymmetric feed of catalysts is to introduce liquid jets in an accordingly asymmetric feeding. The asymmetric feeding will cause complicated three-phase interactions, in terms of the transport and phase change characteristics of each interacting phase, in the feed zone of a riser reactor. This study has developed a theoretical framework with an inertia-based multi-spray interaction, which considers not only a complex geometric intervene of mutual-penetration sprays but also the individual spray properties and feeding operations. Based on the fact that the traverse gradient of pressure is insignificant compared to that of axial gradient in a riser flow, a sub-model is also established to redistribute the gas and solid phases within the cross-section of concern. Due to the lack of experiment data or available information on the asymmetric feeding of catalysts from J-bend, we have also conducted a CFD study of a J-bend dense gas solid flow to obtain the asymmetric distribution catalysts feeding to the feed-zone model. Our modeling examples suggest that the reaction and flow characteristics can be altered noticeably by adjusting asymmetric feedings of liquid reactants, such as changes in droplet penetration, spray coverage and local CTO. In addition, the result of over-penetration of droplets onto the feed zone wall shows the need for a various droplet size/flowrate model rather than mono-sized/constant-flowrate model of liquid phase. This can also assist in better design or selection of the characteristics for the spray nozzle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,157,12,ED4OG,2018/10/13

This absorption, initially driven by the coupling between diffusion and chemical reactions, eventually leads to the apparition of a peculiar gravitational instability with non-monotonic dynamics, and liquid plumes generated at some distance from the gas-liquid interface (Wylock et al., 2014). Considering that this instability is triggered by a Rayleigh Taylor like mechanism, a two-dimensional model, coupling diffusion, chemical reaction and convection, is proposed to simulate the onset and the dynamics of such an instability. It is observed that the simulated instability dynamics agree qualitatively with the experimental observations and that the order of magnitude of the onset time is well estimated. Thanks to the simulation, the interaction between the various phenomena after the instability onset is further investigated and a mechanism is proposed to explain the unusual dynamics of the studied system. It is notably shown that this dynamics is due to the particular non-monotonic liquid density variations with the depth, induced by the absorption. A criterion to obtain such type of density profile is presented. In addition, the simulation enables to assess the influence of the instability on the CO2 absorption rate and it is observed that the generated flow pattern does not lead to a significant enhancement of the gas liquid absorption rate. This result is of significant importance for optimizing chemisorption (e.g. for CO2 capture or sequestration) processes. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,157,15,ED4OG,2018/10/15

Prior studies on shear induced coalescence are restricted to lower volume fraction (up to 20%) of dispersed phase. In this contribution, the effect of shear induced coalescence in a larger range of volume fractions of dispersed phase, and shear rates, is presented. The experimental ranges have practical relevance in the context of industrial coalescers which exploit low shear to coalesce oil-water emulsions. For our work, a synthetic emulsion mimicking the properties of medium-heavy crude is subjected to simple shear. In summary, the studies reveal the effect of shear rate, volume fraction of dispersed phase and viscosity ratio on the evolving drop size distributions of oil phase. For low shear rates and volume fractions, the evolving drop size distributions show a bimodal distribution, while a multimodal nature of drop size population was observed for higher dispersed phase volume fraction (40%), something which has never been reported thus far. Finally, a population balance model employing diameter based coalescence kernel is used to rationalize the time evolution of droplet size distributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, requests for the assessment of vitamin D status have increased dramatically. Despite significant progress in the analysis of vitamin D metabolites and an expansion of our pathophysiological knowledge of vitamin D, the assessment of vitamin D status remains a challenging and partially unresolved issue. Current guidelines from scientific bodies recommend the measurement of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) in blood as the preferred test. However, growing evidence indicates significant limitations of this test, including analytical aspects and interpretation of results. In addition, the relationships between 25-OHD and various clinical indices, such as bone mineral density and fracture risk, are rather weak and not consistent across races. Recent studies have systematically investigated new markers of vitamin D status including the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) (ratio between 25-OHD and 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D), bioavailable 25-OHD [25-OHD not bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP)], and free 25-OHD [circulating 25-OHD bound to neither DBP nor albumin (ALB)]. These parameters may potentially change how we will assess vitamin D status in the future. Although these new biomarkers have expanded our knowledge about vitamin D metabolism, a range of unresolved issues regarding their measurement and the interpretation of results prevent their use in daily practice. It can be expected that some of these issues will be overcome in the near future so that they may be considered for routine use (at least in specialized centers). In addition, genetic studies have revealed several polymorphisms in key proteins of vitamin D metabolism that affect the circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. The affected proteins include DBP, 7-dehydrocholesterol synthase and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Here we aim to review existing knowledge regarding the biochemistry, physiology and measurement of vitamin D. We will also provide an overview of current and emerging biomarkers for the assessment of vitamin D status, with particular attention methodological aspects and their usefulness in clinical practice.",2018,55,24,ED5YS,2018/10/27

Samples were extracted in K-EDTA (2.5 mmol/L) and measured for diluent-corrected K per area (alpha, mu mol K/cm(2)). Results: Forty-three patient samples were utilized. a was normally distributed: alpha(P) = 1.23 +/- 0.26 mu mol K/cm(2); alpha(R) = 1.86 +/- 0.41 mu mol K/cm(2); alpha(R)/alpha(P) = 1.51 +/- 0.15. alpha was correlated with HCT: alpha(P) = 0.030 HCT(%)+0.015 mu mol K/cm(2) (r(2) = 0.795); alpha(R) = 0.052 HCT(%)+0.010 mu mol K/cm(2) (r(2) = 0.912), but with higher resolution and lesser error for a(R). Conclusions: K per area (alpha) was significantly higher in R samples vs. P samples, with higher resolution for alpha(R) vs. HCT. Use of ring samples inclusive of the perimeter to estimate HCT for DBS via K measurement can provide an advantage over use of center sub-punch samples.",2018,55,5,ED5YS,2018/11/1

Three varieties of TRAb have been described: stimulating (S-TRAb), blocking (B-TRAb), and apoptotic (A-TRAb) autoantibodies. Very recently, the first immunoassay method (Immulite TSI assay, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) declared to measure serum S-TRAb concentration, has been made available in an automated commercial platform. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of this new test to identify patients suffering from GD, in comparison with two current IMA methods for total TSH receptor autoantibodies (T-TRAb) measurement. Methods: Sera of 383 subjects [72 patients with untreated GD, 55 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), 36 patients with multinodular non-toxic goiter, 100 patients with other non-thyroid autoimmune diseases (NTAD) and 120 healthy subjects (HS)] were evaluated. Results: The threshold obtained by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 0.54 IU/L, very similar to that proposed by the manufacturer (0.55 IU/L). -Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) were-positive in all GD patients and negative in all but three controls (clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98.7%, respectively). Passing and Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plot showed an acceptable agreement between TSI Immulite assay and other two immunoassay methods (Cobas/Elecsys, Roche and TRAK RIA, BRAHMS Thermo Scientific). Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of fully automated Immulite TSI assay in GD patients is at least comparable to that of current TRAb immunoassays (IMAs) suggesting the possibility of including such assay in rapid and cost-saving diagnostic and monitoring algorithms. However, our results do not provide full evidence that this assay is specific for S-TRAb only, and future studies comparing Immulite TSI assay to stimulating activity are required.",2018,55,7,ED5YS,2018/11/2

Methods: We measured serum ferritin concentrations using four immunoassays: the s-ELISA and the AxSYM (TM) analyzer were compared among 420 non-pregnant Cambodian women; the Centaur (R) XP analyzer, s-ELISA, and AxSYM (TM) analyzer were compared among a subset of 100 Cambodian women; and the s-ELISA and the Elecsys (R) 2010 analyzer were compared among 226 Congolese children aged 6-59 months. Results: Median ferritin concentrations (adjusted for inflammation) ranged between 48 and 91 mu g/L among Cambodian women and between 54 and 55 mu g/L among Congolese children. ID prevalence ranged from 2% to 10% among Cambodian women and 5% to 7% among Congolese children. Bias between methods varied widely (-9 to 45 mu g/L) among women, and was 43 mu g/L among children. Bias was lower when ferritin values outside of the s-ELISA measurement range (> 250 mu g/L) were excluded. Conclusions: The observed differences in ferritin concentrations likely reflect different ferritin isoforms, antibodies, and calibrators used across assays and by different laboratories. However, despite differences in ferritin concentrations, ID prevalence was relatively similar and low across all methods.",2018,55,8,ED5YS,2018/11/3

The aim of this study was to determine the serum activity of DPPIV, its expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and to examine possible correlations with disease activity (DAS28) in untreated patients with eRA. Methods: The study included 50 patients newly diagnosed with RA, who had not received any corticosteroid or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy and whose conventional radiographs of hands and feet showed no structural damage. The control group consisted of 40 healthy volunteers. Also, 30 patients with chronic RA (cRA) were examined. The serum activity of DPPIV was determined by the direct photometric method, while expression of CD26 on PBMC was determined using flow cytometry. Results: Decreased DPPIV serum activity was detected in patients with eRA and cRA compared to the control group (p = 0.024, p < 0.0001, respectively). Although, the percentage of overall CD26+ white blood cells (WBC) was significantly decreased in eRA patients (p < 0.001), the percentage of CD26+ lymphocytes and monocytes and mean fluorescence intensity of CD26 on these cells in eRA patients showed no significant difference compared to healthy volunteers. DAS28 showed no significant correlation with CD26 expression or DPPIV serum activity, but a significant inverse correlation between the duration of symptoms and DPPIV serum activity was observed.

We provide a hypothesis- generating screen for further research by exploring the expression profile and genetic variability of caspases (2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10) in breast carcinoma patients. This study addressed isoform-specific caspase transcript expression and genetic variability in regulatory sequences of caspases 2 and 9. Methods: Gene expression profiling was performed by quantitative real-time PCR in tumor and paired non-malignant tissues of two independent groups of patients. Genetic variability was determined by high resolution melting, allelic discrimination, and sequencing analysis in tumor and peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA of the patients. Results: CASP3 A+ B and S isoforms were over-expressed in tumors of both patient groups. The CASP9 transcript was down-regulated in tumors of both groups of patients and significantly associated with expression of hormonal receptors and with the presence of rs4645978-rs2020903rs4646034 haplotype in the CASP9 gene.

As an important EMT marker gene, CDH1 (E-cadherin) expression and its clinical implication in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely elusive. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was carried out to examine CDH1 transcript level in 123 de novo AML patients and 34 controls. Results: Compared with controls, CDH1 was significantly downregulated in AML (p < 0.001). The median level of CDH1 expression divided total AML patients into CDH1 low-expressed (CDH1(low)) and CDH1 high-expressed (CDH1(high)) groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, peripheral blood cell counts, complete remission (CR) rate, and the distribution of FAB/WHO subtypes as well as karyotypes/karyotypic classifications (p > 0.05).

In this study we-investigated the association of MHR with CIN in-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: Consecutive STEMI patients treated with primary PCI were prospectively recruited. Subjects were categorized into two groups; as patients who developed CIN (CIN+) and patients who did not develop CIN (CIN-) during hospitalization. CIN was defined as either a 25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline or 44.20 mu mol/L increase in absolute value, within 72 h of intravenous contrast administration.

Recent studies indicate that adropin, a newly identified peptide, participates in cardiovascular health through the regulation of several metabolic events including angiogenesis and blood flow. In this study, we aimed to determine the relation of adropin with biochemical and radiologic parameters which reflect ED such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), endothelin 1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) along with the routine biochemical measurements in patients recently diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: Fasting blood samples from 110 patients with MetS diagnosed according to the NCEP ATP III-2005 criteria were collected to measure the concentrations of adropin and other parameters including the lipid profile, insulin and glucose. Serum NOx concentrations were determined by measuring NO2 plus NO3. FMD test was performed by ultrasonography, and patients were stratified as FMD (+) or (-).

We wanted to develop a simple colorimetric method for assaying FN3K activity in human body fluids. Methods: Glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained by glycation with a 10% glucose solution at 37 degrees C. After 72 h, glycated BSA was dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4). The dialyzed solution (containing +/- 1000 mu mol/L fructosamine) was used as an FN3K substrate. In the assay, 300 mu L of substrate was incubated with 50 mu L of serum and 100 mu L of MgCl 2 (0.7 mmol/L)/ATP (3.2 mmol/L). The fructosamine concentration was determined at the start and after incubation (120 min, 25 degrees C). The decrease in fructosamine concentration over time is a measure for the FN3K activity (1 U corresponding to 1 mu mol/min). Concomitantly, the FN3K SNP rs1056534 and the ferroportin SNP rs1156350 were genotyped. Results: Within-assay CV was 6.0%. Reference values for FN3K activity in serum were 14.2 +/- 1.6 U/L (n = 143). Reference values for FN3K were neither age-nor sex-dependent. The various FN3K SNP rs1056534 genotypes showed no significant differences in serum FN3K activity. In diabetics (n = 191), values (14.0 +/- 2.2 U/L) were comparable to those of the controls. FN3K activity in erythrocytes was significantly higher (170.3 +/- 7.6 U/L). The intra-erythrocytic FN3K activity makes the results prone to hemolysis. FN3K activity depended on the ferroportin Q248H genotypes, with the highest value for the wild type genotype. Neither transferrin saturation nor ferritin were confounders for the FN3K activity. FN3K activity was significantly (p < 0.0001) correlated with HbA(1c) values, although the correlation between FN3K and HbA(1c) was weak. Conclusions: The simple colorimetric method allows determining FN3K activity in human serum.

In this study, the authors measured the ac breakdown voltages of dry-cured and E-E type 6.6-kV XLPE cables removed after 18 to 25 years of operation and observed the water trees in their XLPE insulation. As a result, it was observed that breakdown voltages were larger than the maximum operating voltage (6.9 kV) and the ac voltage for the dielectric withstanding test (10.3 kV). Water trees were mainly bow-tie water trees and their maximum length was approximately 1 mm.

In a conventional single-phase inverter, power pulsation at twice the grid frequency appears in the input power. Hence, electrolytic capacitors having large capacitances have been connected to the DC input terminal to stabilize the input DC-bus voltage. Because the lifetime of the electrolytic capacitor is relatively shorter than that of another component, the lifetime of the inverter is affected by the capacitor. In order to prevent such a problem, a novel single-phase inverter circuit with an active power decoupling function is introduced. The pulsating power on the input DC-bus line and the pulsated energy on the input DC capacitor is transferred to the energy in a small film capacitor. Hence, the extension of the inverter lifetime can be expected by substituting a small film capacitor for the large electrolytic capacitors. In addition, the loss in the power decoupling circuit is very small; hence, the reduction in the overall conversion efficiency of the inverter can be minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a 300 W experimental setup. (C). 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018,198,10,ED7LT,2018/11/16

As with many distributed parameter systems, fluid flow can be controlled using boundary value manipulation. Fluid manipulation using electro-osmosis is studied in this work, where several cylindrical electrodes are used to create multiple spatially non-uniform time-varying electric fields. The proposed approach converts the distributed parameter system into an infinite-dimensional system by spatial and spectral discretization. A virtual output variable is constructed to allow the optimization of a mixing objective function to be conducted using frequency response analysis, with consideration of the constraints of conservation of charge. The solution obtained in this paper is the input profile that provides the greatest achievable ratio of time-average dissipation function to time-average input energy satisfying the input constraints.

In this study, the removal of fine particles in a tertiary sedimentation tank mounting an adjustable baffle was investigated using the computational fluid dynamics code-COMSOL. The solid-fluid motion was solved by consecutively applying the equations of the continuity and momentum using the finite element method. The experiment was conducted by the sedimentation tank with the adjustable baffle inclined at 30 degrees in a pilot scale plant. It's used as the reference data set for numerical simulations that were run on a 2-dimensional domain by modifying the configuration settings of angles for an adjustable baffle (i.e., 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees) and without one. Results showed that the simulation results matched well with the experimental data for an adjustable baffle at 30 degrees (NSE=0.97). The sedimentation tank with the adjustable baffle at different angles had a lower overflow rate (in the area of flow rebound) and mixing intensity (in the area of flow curve) than without one, eventually leading to enhanced particle removal efficiency. This tendency became more pronounced as the particle motion stabilized over time. The sedimentation tank mounting the adjustable baffle at 30 degrees provided the best settling efficiency among the four different flow patterns. However, the conventional index that represents the mixing properties did not correctly address their relative efficiency for fine particle removal. Therefore, a numerical simulation tailored to a given geometry should be conducted to fully elucidate the fluid dynamics in the sedimentation tank with complex devices or obstacles.

The increase of equivalence ratio (Phi) extended the velocity limits (v) of self-sustaining combustion in varying degrees for the three fuels under study. Methane presented a relatively narrow self-sustaining combustion region, low conversion (<= 25%), high CO selectivity (5-11%) and low tube wall temperature (< 250 degrees C) at Phi = 1.0 and v = 0.8-1.4 m/s. The catalytic reactivity for methane oxidization over Pt/ZSM-5 was highly activated at temperatures over 455 degrees C, this being responsible for the methane combustion performance. In the case of propane combustion processes, a homogenous reaction occurred downstream the catalyst section and led to high conversion. Under Phi = 1.0 and v = 0.8-1.4 m/s conditions, propane conversion was higher than 45% while the CO2 selectivity remained over 96%. n-Octane showed similar combustion performance than propane, with a little backward gap detected. The released heat by fuel combustion increased in the order: methane, n-octane, and propane, with the maximum heat values being 12, 19, and 32 W, respectively.

They are of a semi-empirical type, since they are based on power laws involving at least Weber and Reynolds numbers. The pre-factors are determined by fitting the experimental data on droplet diameters in the various configurations. The main cause for the discrepancies in the fitting constant between different flow types is the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of the turbulent field, especially the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate epsilon. This feature explains why there is no universal physical model suitable for breakup prediction throughout the range of flow geometries. In the present work, we investigate the drop size distribution by reference to Hinze's actual theory in a local approach, attempting a direct interpretation thanks to the turbulence spectra measured (by LDA) in the most dissipative locations of a flow which is basically inhomogeneous. This method allows estimation of droplet size with no constant fitting and with acceptable accuracy; however the knowledge of the turbulence field is required. The present study is carried out with low dispersed-phase fraction, so that the coalescence is negligible. Experiments show that the ""typical value"" for the TKE dissipation rate to fit the raw model of Hinze and Kolmogorov lies between the maximum and the mean value in the flow field.

Thus, the goal of this research is to improve fundamental understanding of rotary calcination to aid in the creation of a scientific methodology for process design and scale-up. For successful calcination to occur, the residence time of the particles must exceed the time required for heating and calcination at a set temperature. The optimal residence time therefore depends on both of these competing time scales, each of which is function of feed material properties, kiln geometry and kiln operating conditions. For uniform treatment of the feed, the particles must also exhibit low axial dispersion. In this work, the residence time distribution and axial dispersion coefficient for a dry cohesive fluid cracking catalyst powder were measured in a pilot plant kiln using a tracer study developed by Danckwerts. Results were successfully matched to the Taylor fit of the axial dispersion model and the Sullivan prediction for mean residence time. It was found that an increase in feed rate, kiln incline and rotary speed decreased mean residence time and overall axial dispersion. Such results have been established previously for free-flowing material like millimeter-sized extrudates, but have not been previously reported for the cohesive powders such as the one used in our work. As in free-flowing material, the axial dispersion coefficient was found to vary with kiln conditions. The values of the axial dispersion coefficients were lower for the powder than for free-flowing material, showing a dependency of axial dispersion on material properties as well as bulk flow behavior.",2018,158,8,ED7SA,2018/11/25

Accordingly, the current review targets at providing a comprehensive landscape of the experimental cluster trends to summarize the findings, in particular on circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers, to date. More questions than answers seem to have sprouted from the abundant experimental data available, which impedes model development.

Theories that allow for estimating the adhesion force, or the force to separate surfaces from contact, with simple, single-equation theories (i.e., by considering roughness asperities as submerged-spheres) can be easily instituted in discrete element method simulations of many-particle systems, but require inputs that rely on quantification of the surface roughness. In this work, Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) topographical surface maps reveal that two scales of roughness characterize the surfaces of particles examined, similar to prior studies. Previously, the separation of the two roughness scales and determination of the associated wavelength, which are necessary for predicting adhesion forces, relied on visual selection. Here, an objective methodology to separate the scales of surface roughness and calculate the wavelength of each scale is established. Two artifacts are identified when using the new methodology that negatively impact adhesion force predictions if not eliminated, namely the Gibbs artifact and an ""atomic-scale-noise"" artifact. Procedures to overcome these artifacts are developed. The resulting surface roughness characterizations are employed in a new theory, the predictions of which are in excellent agreement with AFM pull-off force measurements.

For both the complete problem, and its single components (the filter plate and a bed of spheres of finite height) we have observed three flow regimes, depending on the Reynolds number. In each regime the flow resistance is showing a different scaling with the Reynolds number. In the Stokes flow regime the total flow resistance can be decomposed in linear independent components. The interior flows inside the filter holes and inside the packed bed follow the same correlations as hold for the single component. However, at the transition zone between filter plate and packed bed, there is a diverging flow in the first row of the packed bed, whose contribution in the flow resistance scales with the fractional hole to the power -1.5. Similar scaling exponent has been found earlier for the viscous-inertial regime with Reynolds numbers larger than 10, which has been modelled using the porous medium approach. Our findings suggest that also in the Stokes flow and the weakly flow regime the problem can also be solved with the same porous medium approach using the Navier-Stokes equation having Darcy-Brinkman terms incorporated.

The bed-volume expansion and dissipation rate are introduced to evaluate the overall fluidization and energy loss of the bed, respectively. The standard deviation and fast Fourier transform signal processing technique are also employed in the investigation of bed quality. The results show that significant flow phenomena occur around bubbles with both the greatest energy loss and large gradients of pressure and velocity. For inlet air without pulsation, the Reynolds number is the major dimensionless parameter influencing the bed flow. Both the bed-volume expansion and dissipation rate (dimensionless) linearly increase with the Reynolds number. As the inlet air flows faster and more kinetic energy is transferred into the bed, the uniformity of the bed decreases and relatively less energy is lost. For inlet air with pulsation, the Strouhal number is the major influential dimensionless parameter. The bed-volume expansion drops to nearly a constant as the Strouhal number increases. The non-linear effects of the Strouhal number on the dissipation rate of the bed are approximated through a logarithmic function. With an increase in pulsation frequency, the bed fluctuation decreases and more energy is lost. The pulsation amplitude should be small to form an ADMFB with uniformity and relatively low energy loss. In general, pulsation inhibits bed-volume expansion and greater energy loss is incurred. In practice, pulsation might be used to maintain a bubbling state in a bed with high kinetic energy.",2019,158,8,ED7SA,2018/12/5

As predicted by the thermodynamic model, the hydrate equilibrium conditions were shifted toward lower-temperature and higher-pressure conditions. The equilibrium temperature depression data were interpolated linearly with the NaCl concentration in the MEG solution. The addition of NaCl affected the hydrate onset time and subcooling temperature only slightly, but their addition decreases the initial growth rate and hydrate volume fraction in the liquid phase. By increasing the NaCl concentration to 7.0 wt% in a MEG 20 wt% solution, the initial growth rate reduced to 0.2 vol%/min from 2.3 vol%/min of pure water, while the hydrate fraction was decreased to 18.7 vol% from 78.9 vol% of pure water; moreover, the torque change during the hydrate formation shows severe spikes for pure water with a maximum relative torque of 20 for the pure water. The addition of the 7.0 wt% NaCl to the MEG 20 wt% solution, however, only showed a negligible torque increase. The growth rate starts to decrease when the torque starts to rise for pure water, suggesting that the agglomeration of the hydrate particles may induce a mass-transfer limitation or slow down the particle growth. The presence of NaCl and MEG in the aqueous phase seems to minimize the interaction between the hydrate particles by surrounding the hydrate particle with the NaCl and MEG. These results proved that the NaCl plays a synergist role for the MEG in an under-inhibition condition by further limiting the hydrate fraction and minimizing the resistance-to-flow.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces.

This liquid film leaves the disc tangentially and breaks up to form ligaments and/or droplets. Variation of the droplet size with film thickness is very important for droplet size prediction. In the present work, a steady state, three dimensional and two phase CFD model is used to simulate this process and to obtain the liquid film thickness. The effect of different parameters like inlet flow rate, disc rotational speed, etc. on the thickness of the liquid film is studied using dimensional analysis. A correlation is developed for obtaining the liquid film thickness at the disc edge using linear least square analysis. Further correlation is obtained, using which the droplet size is predicted from the film thickness at varying operating parameters.",2019,158,7,ED7SA,2018/12/12

To investigate the dependence of the structural and dynamical properties of hydrated protons in Hyfion (R) perfluorosulfonic acid membranes with various water uptake values on the channel size, a series of molecular dynamics simulations based on an all-atom force field were conducted. The water uptake dependence of the hydrated proton diffusivity determined from our simulations was consistent with the experimental results in literature, which verified the simulation systems. A probability distribution of the hydrated proton complex is proposed to characterize the confinement effect of the proton conductive channel on the hydrated proton structure in the membranes with different morphologies. By means of local structural properties and pair-potential energies, a reasonable hydrogen bond criterion was employed to characterize the structures of the hydrated proton complexes. It was found that the nanochannels confined the structure of the hydrated proton complex and that confined complexes of H9O4+, H7O3+ and H5O2+ were dominant. Weakening the confinement by increasing the channel size was beneficial for the formation of the H9O4+ complex, the probability distribution of which gradually became plateau. Thus, H9O4+ can be considered the stable structure of the confined hydrated proton complex in polymer electrolyte membranes. This work is helpful in understanding the relationship between the structure of the confined hydrated proton and the proton conductive channel.

We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between the ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and dynamics. We build on previous studies to highlight the role of viscosity contrast in determining the morphology of mantle plumes and provide detailed visualizations and quantitative information on the convection phenomenon. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection regimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and plate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume structures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the perfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is systematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the bottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure. As the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is observed from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes, accompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing. In the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into intermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume hot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (1/300), the regime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we observe for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with cellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes. We use experimental data to quantify these morphological changes and mixing dynamics of the plumes at different regimes of U. We also compare our observations on plume spacing with various models reported in the literature by varying the viscosity ratio and the buoyancy flux.",2019,158,12,ED7SA,2018/12/14

Thus, reliable and simple mathematical models for mass transfer rate calculation are essential. Models which apply to parallel interacting and non-interacting reactions, for all industrially relevant reaction regimes must be developed and validated against experimental measurements. In a previous work, we presented the general model (GM) enhancement factor model for (m+n)-th order reversible reactions and validated it against the numerical solution of the two-film model for absorption, desorption and pinch conditions. In this work, we apply the GM model to multiple parallel reactions. We deduce the model for piperazine (PZ) CO(2)capture and we validate it against wetted-wall column measurements using 2, 5 and 8 molal PZ for temperatures between 40 degrees C and 100 degrees C and CO2 loadings between 0.23 and 0.41 mol CO2/2 mol PZ. We show that overall second order kinetics describes well the reaction between CO2 and PZ accounting for the carbamate and bicarbamate reactions. Here we prove the GM model for piperazine and MEA but we expect that this practical approach is applicable for various amines, blends of amines and promoted amines with similar kinetics. We believe that this practical implementation of mass transfer rate calculation will be in the accuracy range of a wetted wall column experiment for other parallel reaction systems. This is in line with our observation from other similar solvents studied, not shown here. Furthermore, we compare the GM model and the numerical solution of the complete two-film model predictions to MEA wetted-wall data and we prove that it is safe to assume that GM and the two-film model give practically identical results.

The high speed recording technique was utilized to elucidate the fluid dynamics of two-phase flow in parallel micro-channels. It was found that the phase distribution characteristics of two-phase flow in parallel channels highly depended on the inlet gas slug length and the inlet real velocity, and the channels in the front of the header can influence the phase distribution of the adjacent channel in the rear.

To investigate the effectiveness of immobilizing Cd-bearing residues, two iron oxide precursors, hematite (alpha-Fe3O4) and magnetite (Fe3O4), were reacted with cadmium oxide (CdO) at 600-850 degrees C for 3 h. The XRD results showed that cadmium ferrite spinel (CdFe2O4) was the only Cd-hosting product phase in both systems. Both of the iron oxides were found to be efficient in incorporating Cd into the CdFe2O4 spinel structure, but Fe3O4 was more reactive in the Cd incorporated at low temperatures. The weight factions of the crystalline phases in the sintered products were quantified by the Rietveld refinement method, and the transformation ratio (TR) index was used to reveal the Cd incorporation efficiencies of the iron oxides. A TR of 100% was achieved at 850 degrees C, indicating the potential for efficient stabilization of Cd through thermal reactions with iron oxide precursors. The Cd stabilization effects were further assessed by leaching CdFe2O4 and CdO in constant pH (2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) leaching tests. The results revealed the incongruent dissolution of CdFe2O4. The amount of Cd leached from the CdFe2O4 was more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that from the CdO, signifying a highly promising and reliable strategy for Cd stabilization. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to systematically report the roles of different Fe-rich precursors in Cd stabilization mechanism, and indicates the significant reduction of Cd leachability via CdFe2O4 formation.

The main way to strengthen the recovery of fine-grained minerals is further improvement of the highly-turbulent flow field of the pipe flow unit in the flotation column. With a decrease of fine-grained mineral diameter, the turbulence intensity in the pipe flow should be increased so as to strengthen the recovery of the fine-grained mineral. In this paper, the effect of vortex generators (VGs) on the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in a pipe flow unit are primarily investigated by numerical simulations. The results showed that a staggered arrangement (S=20 mm) exhibited the maximum volume-averaged turbulence kinetic energy and volume-averaged turbulence dissipation rate among different arrangements of VG arrays in the pipe flow unit. Streamwise vorticity was formed behind the VGs along the flow direction. With an increase of VG arrays from 0 to 5, the volume-averaged turbulence kinetic energy increased from 0.015 m(2)/s(2) to 0.05 m(2)/s(2). Similarly, with an increase of VG arrays from 0 to 5, the volume-averaged turbulence dissipation rate in the pipe flow unit increased from 1.99 m(2)/s(3) to 11.8 m(2)/s(3). A flotation experiment using coal slime was conducted by using different structures of pipe flow unit (including empty pipe and pipe with different VG arrays).

This article presents a computational study of the breakage of high aspect ratio particles subject to mechanical agitation using the Discrete Element Method (DEM), in which a particle, represented by a string of bonded spheres, breaks at the center of a bond where the tensile or shear stress exceeds the material strength. The numerical model is validated using experimental results from the breakage of blackboard chalk sticks subject to uniaxial compression in a cylindrical container. The validated model is used to investigate particle breakage when agitated by rotating blades, which is encountered in a range of pharmaceutical processes, such as agitated filter drying, rotary tablet press feeding, and powder blending. The simulation results show that the breakage rate, that is the rate of particle size reduction (or the rate of fragment mass increase), increases as the applied pressure, impeller rotational speed, particle-particle friction, or particle-equipment friction increases. However, the extent of breakage per impeller revolution is independent of impeller rotational speed. Most importantly, it is found that the extent of particle breakage is a function of the work performed on the material, and the parameters in this function depend on the particle-particle and particle-wall friction coefficients. Large friction coefficients enable the input energy to break the particles more efficiently.",2019,158,14,ED7SA,2018/12/21

Recent experiments showed that sulfidation of nanoscopic zinc oxide particles leads to an outward growth and the formation of voids inside the particles. In this work, we derive a micro-scale model to describe this phenomenon. The model accounts for nucleation and growth of voids inside the particles, diffusion of Zn and O through the product layer, and deposition of the solid product at the particle surface as a result of the reaction between ZnO and H2S. The model is thus opposite to the well known shrinking core model where an inward growth of the product layer is assumed. To explore the effect of the outward growth on the dynamics of a packed bed adsorber the micro-scale model is combined with a macro-scale model that accounts for intra-pellet diffusion and convection along the packed bed. In the limit of fast nucleation and growth of voids inside the zinc oxide particles, the micro-scale model shows a qualitatively similar conversion profile to the shrinking core model, while when nucleation controls an inflection point in conversion profile is found. On the macro-scale, the outward growth can cause the clogging of pores inside the pellets which prevents the pellets from reaching full conversion. This leads to shorter breakthrough times of the packed bed due to the sealing of unreacted zinc oxide. Our results thus provide a possible explanation of the incomplete conversion of zinc oxide in packed beds.",2019,158,12,ED7SA,2018/12/22

Different approaches for modular plant design have been developed, for example in the CoPIRIDE or F-3 factory project. They have in common that reductions in design and construction expenses for modular equipment and its assembly are expected e.g. by preassembly of modules in a workshop under controlled conditions resulting in less field work on the construction site for erection. However, the main disadvantage of the modular approach is the loss of economy of scale. Thus, the effective impact of the modular concept concerning the fixed capital investment has to be investigated. In this article, a new approach for estimating fixed capital investment of modular production plants will be presented and applied using a generic example. Based on the results we expect that positive effects through modularization on engineering and construction costs can nearly compensate the loss of economy of scale. In the investigated example investment costs of the modular plant are 12% higher than for the comparable conventionally built plant. Such increase could allow other effects that are attributed to the modular concept to be employed to advantage.

We show empirically the oil consumption increases linearly with the specific surface area of the particles, with an average oil film thickness of 178 nm for fine coal particles, well below the level required for conventional oil agglomeration. The new approach is ultrafast, achieving agglomeration within seconds under batch conditions, with strong selectivity. We also show for the first time continuous steady state agglomeration can be achieved by simply passing the feed and binder suspensions through a partially closed ball valve. Here the residence time through the valve is less than 0.1 s. And, by subjecting the agglomerated product to further shear, the emulsion is inverted, releasing bound water.

The estimation of particle sizes by this method requires the solution of an inverse problem using a suitable scattering model that takes into account size, shape and optical properties of the particles. However, laser diffraction instruments are usually accompanied by software that employs a default scattering model for spherical particles, which is then used to solve the inverse problem even though a significant number of particulate products occur in strongly non-spherical shapes such as needles. In this work, we demonstrate that using the spherical model for the estimation of sizes of needle-like particles can lead to the appearance of artefacts in the form of multimodal populations of particles with size modes much smaller than those actually present in the sample.

This study focusses on the kinetics of the production of gamma-alerolactone from three different esters of levulinic acid using Ru supported on activated carbon as hydrogenation catalyst.

The transformation of these alkyl levulinates proceeds through a hydrogenation of the substrate to the intermediate gamma-hydroxy valeriate followed by lactonization to form gamma-valerolactone. Alkyl levulinates with shorter alkyl residue show an accelerated formation of gamma-valerolactone. Nevertheless, an efficient transformation of all alkyl levulinates into gamma-valerolactone is possible. The kinetic study indicates that at all reaction temperatures, lactonization occurs slower than hydrogenation and presents the rate-determining step. Analysis of the kinetic data shows the activation energies of hydrogenation and lactonization increase in the following order: methly levulinate < ethyl levulinate < butyl levulinate. Furthermore, activation energies for the hydrogenation and lactonization steps of the studied alkyl levulinates are in the range of 41-58 kJ mol(-1) and 50-63 kJ mol(-1), respectively, emphasizing the potential of alkyl levulinates as promising intermediates for.valerolactone formation.",2019,158,7,ED7SA,2018/12/31

Our specific aim is to elucidate the origin of hysteresis, especially in those pores having one end closed to the bulk gas surroundings. These pores, despite their simplicity, capture many fundamental aspects of how molecules adsorb and are restructured in pores, which results from the interplay between a number of fundamental processes: (1) molecular layering, (2) clustering, (3) capillary condensation and evaporation and (4) molecular ordering. We have found that pore size, surface affinity and temperature are the most important parameters influencing these processes. The inter-relationship between them is highly significant in determining the possible existence of a hysteresis loop. Two classes of loop have been identified: (1) a condensation and evaporation loop and (2) a restructuring loop. Our simulations show that the origins of hysteresis stem from the following causes: (1) Different curvatures of the interface separating the adsorbed layer and the gas-like phase during adsorption and desorption. This always occurs in open ended pores when the temperature is below the critical hysteresis temperature and, most interestingly, is manifested in closed end pores only when the surface affinity is very weak; (2) Low temperatures, where the adsorbate become solid-like as filling progresses in both open and closed end pores; (3) Restructuring of the condensed phase in both open and closed end pores of specific pore size where the adsorbate changes from a liquid-like state to a solid-like state.",2019,158,18,ED7SA,2019/1/1

From this it was observed that for higher Re flows, the through-wall velocity profile became less uniform, and the implications that this has on particulate matter deposition are discussed. The MR technique demonstrated herein provides a useful method to advance our understanding of hydrodynamics and mass transfer within DPFs and also for the validation of numerical simulations used in their design and optimization.",2019,158,10,ED7SA,2019/1/3

This work concerns the experimental investigation of the dual effect of viscosity on gas holdup and flow regime transition as well as bubble size distributions in a large-diameter and large-scale bubble column. The bubble column is 5.3 m in height, has an inner diameter of 0.24 m, and can be operated with gas superficial velocities in the range of 0.004-0.20 m/s. Air was used as the dispersed phase, and various water-monoethylene glycol solutions were employed as the liquid phase. The water-monoethylene glycol solutions that were tested correspond to a viscosity between 0.9 mPa s and 7.97 mPa s, a density between 997.086 kg/m(3) and 1094.801 kg/m(3), a surface tension between 0.0715 N/m and 0.0502 N/m, and log(10)(Mo) between -10.77 and -6.55 (where Mo is the Morton number). Gas holdup measurements were used to investigate the global fluid dynamics and the flow regime transition between the homogeneous flow regime and the transition flow regime. An image analysis method was used to investigate the bubble size distributions and shapes for different gas superficial velocities, for different solutions of watermonoethylene glycol. In addition, based on the experimental data from the image analysis, a correlation between the bubble equivalent diameter and the bubble aspect ratio was proposed. The dual effect of viscosity, previously verified in smaller bubble columns, was confirmed not only with respect to the gas holdup and flow regime transition, but also for the bubble size distributions. Low viscosities stabilize the homogeneous flow regime and increase the gas holdup, and are characterized by a larger number of small bubbles. Conversely, higher viscosities destabilize the homogeneous flow regime and decrease the gas holdup, and the bubble size distribution moves toward large bubbles. The experimental results suggest that the stabilization/destabilization of the homogeneous regime is related to the changes in the bubble size distributions and a simple approach, based on the lift force, was proposed to explain this relationship. Finally, the experimental results were compared to the dual effect of organic compounds and inorganic compounds: future studies should propose a comprehensive theory to explain all the dual effects observed.",2019,158,30,ED7SA,2019/1/5

For this purpose, a mechanochemical synthesis route was proposed for the first time for preparation of water stable indium metal-organic frameworks InOF-1. The effects of preparation conditions such as the addition of solvents and grinding time were discussed, and the InOF-1 synthesized through optimized condition was used to investigate its selective CO2 adsorption. Results showed that using liquid-assisted grinding for 20 min with CH3CN (0.4 mL) could lead to highly crystalline and porous InOF-1 with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 707 m(2)/g. The addition of a small amount of solvent into the system could dramatically improve the crystallinity and porosity of InOF-1. More importantly, the synthesized product with the highest specific surface area retained its crystallinity and porosity after being soaked in water for 12 h.

Comparison with dissolution rate of air and CO2 bubbles reveals hardly a diameter change for air bubbles, in contrast with near-total dissolution of CO2 bubbles within the 2 m column height. Comparison with 1D numerical analysis on single rising bubbles and previous 3D CFD simulations of small bubble swarms show a fair agreement although certain deviations are encountered.

During their operation, 3D objects are formed by repeating cycles of drawing a UV-curable resin with inkjet nozzles and then solidifying it with UV irradiation. In this study, the activity performed by a 3D UV inkjet printer was simulated by spin casting a 33 mu m thick layer of UV-curable resin (containing diurethanedimethacrylate and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone compounds mixed at a weight ratio of 99:1) onto a Si wafer followed by photopolymerization for 2 s at a UV irradiation of 10 mW cm(-2). Afterwards, the second resin layer with a thickness of 33 mu m was spun-cast onto the first layer and photopolymerized under the same conditions. The conversion distribution of C= C bonds in the UV-curable resin was investigated via confocal laser Ramanmicroscopy and numerical calculations, which took into account the kinetics of photopolymerization and oxygen inhibition reactions. The confocal laser Raman microscopy technique provided a unique distribution of the C=C bond conversion across the film depth. Thus, the conversion magnitude at a depth of 0 mu m was zero and increased to 0.2 at 6 mu m. Afterwards, the slope of the conversion distribution plot became moderate until the conversion reached the value of 0.43 at a film depth of 28 mu m. Between the film depths of 28 and 38 mu m, the conversion remained constant with a variation not exceeding 0.03. After that, the conversion value increased again, reaching the magnitude of 0.48 at a depth of 50 mu m and remained constant in the region between 50 and 56 mu m (with a variation not exceeding 0.04). At higher depths, the graph slope became moderate again, and the conversion value increased gradually to 0.51 at 66 mu m, after which the silicon wafer was reached. As a result, two different plateaus were observed on the conversion distribution plot: between 28 and 38 mu m and between 50 and 56 mu m (the corresponding conversion variation in these regions was below 0.05). The obtained experimental data were in good agreement with the results of numerical calculations, which attributed the existence of the two plateaus on the plot of the C=C bond conversion distribution to the formation of an oxygen-lean point. In addition, the effects of the UV intensity, irradiation time, lamination time, photoinitiator concentration, and concentration of dissolved oxygen on the oxygen concentration and conversion distributions across the depth direction have been examined. The obtained results revealed that the increases in the UV intensity, irradiation time, and photoinitiator concentration as well as the decrease in the initial dissolved oxygen concentration effectively increased the conversion of C=C bonds in the resin film and decreased the thickness of an unpolymerized layer.",2019,158,11,ED7SA,2019/1/9

Solution-processed thin solid films may be fabricated by casting a thin liquid film followed by a drying step. It has been shown that by imposing a low-amplitude ultrasonic vibration on the substrate, the physical and structural characteristics of the resulting thin solid films is improved, significantly. Therefore, in this study, to investigate and rationalize the aforementioned findings, the evolution and stability of thin and ultrathin films of Newtonian liquid solutions, subjected to vertical and horizontal ultrasonic vibration is studied, using the long-wave approximation and negligible inertia forces. An explicit criterion is obtained for the film instability. Consistent with established theories, it is found that the vertical vibration tends to destabilize the thin liquid film, although for ultrasonic vibrations with low-amplitude, the term contributing to the perturbation growth rate decays rapidly with time and the film may remain stable. However, the vertical ultrasonic vibration is found as a significant destabilizing force, if the film thickness is near a critical value in which case the destabilizing van der Waals and stabilizing gravity and surface tension forces balance one another. To validate the model, experiments on thin liquid films of dilute polymeric solutions are performed. It is found that while imposing ultrasonic vibration may potentially destabilize and breakup the thin film, imposing a low-power vibration can significantly improve the homogeneity, electrical properties, and uniformity of the film, whereas a large-amplitude vibration may have a detrimental effect, because of excessive mixing and agitation of the liquid film or cracking of the resulting thin solid film.",2019,158,12,ED7SA,2019/1/11

Silicon nanoparticles were synthesized using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique. The nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water to introduce hydroxyl functional groups on the surface. The surface functionalization was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The effect of nano-Si concentration on the water vapor permeation properties of the TFN membranes was investigated in detail. The hydroxyl functional groups resulted in significant improvement of surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the nanocomposite membranes which in turn enhanced the water solubilization. The small size of nanoparticles permitted extensive interaction between the nanoparticles and the thin film polyamide layer. Increase in the nano-Si concentration resulted in improvement of water vapor permeance and selectivity till 0.5 w/w%, above which the selectivity decreased because of the interference in interfacial polymerization reaction due to the dilution of aqueous phase monomer and high loading of nanoparticles.

However, gas replacement is restricted to the slow diffusion-limited transport of CO2 caused by the formation of a mixed hydrate layer, and little attention has been paid to the storage of CO2. Therefore, this study proposed a combination of CH4/CO2 replacement and thermal stimulation to enhance CH4 recovery and CO2 storage. The effects of the methane hydrate saturation level, replacement zone, and freezing point on the replacement were analyzed. The CH4 replacement percentage and energy efficiency were obtained and compared using the replacement and combined methods. The results suggested that the combined method effectively improved CH4 recovery, with the CH4 replacement percentage exhibiting an upper limit of 64.63%. Moreover, In CH4/CO2 replacement, the total number of moles of CO2 stored is unequal to CH4 recovered, because the replacement is sensitive to the free water in the pores of the hydrate sediments.

The significant shift in the equilibrium line of the CH4 + neohexane (2,2-dimethylbutane, NH) hydrates replaced with CO2 (10%) + N-2 (90%) and CO2 (20%) + N-2 (80%) indicates that CH4 molecules in the sH hydrates were significantly exchanged with flue gas mixtures. Furthermore, C-13 NMR spectroscopy revealed that replacement using flue gas occurs without a structural transition, and that CO2 molecules preferentially attack CH4 molecules occupied in the medium 4(3)5(6)6(3) cages of sH hydrates. The extent of the CH4 + NH - flue gas replacement was approximately 74%. During CH4 - flue gas replacement in sH hydrates, there was no significant change in heat flow associated with the dissociation and subsequent reformation of gas hydrates. Dissociation enthalpies of gas hydrates before and after replacement, measured using a high-pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter (HP mu-DSC), also supported isostructural replacement with the high extent of reaction.

Efficient p-cresol (and Cu2+) adsorption was mainly due to the hydrophobic interaction of p-cresol (and the complexation of Cu2+) with RL- anions in the interlayer of RL-LDH. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most structures of interest have, until now, been produced in small volume wet chemical batch approaches which are difficult to scale. In extension to the growing interest in continuous flow process for the scalable synthesis of single phase nanomaterials, here we describe the formation of two-phase core-shell particles. Specifically, the coating of silver onto colloidal silica particles using a static T-mixer approach is presented. The coating is achieved in a single reaction step in which careful control of educt concentration and process conditions leads to nucleation and surface conformal growth of silver. Through two generations of reactor, good coating yield and process reproducibility are demonstrated. In particular, the ability to control the characteristic time of mixing, as verified by the Villermaux-Dushmann reaction, was shown to be crucial in narrowing the range of morphologies obtained in the product particles. Moreoverive could tune, through process parameters, the degree of coating of the core particles, leading to patchy particles, Janus particles and even complete nanoshells. Since silver nanostructures have a strong structure-dependent plasmon resonance, we could verify the coating morphologies via optical spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. Optical measurements were also used in order to optimize, via trial and error, the continuous flow process parameters to produce a high coating yield. This opens up future potential for feedback-driven optimization of particle coating. Finally, we demonstrate that the silver coatings can be morphologically stabilized, opening up the possibility of effective formulation for applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main purpose of this study was to test heterogeneous catalysts to transform the FFAs from a oil (oleic acid + canola oil) used as a model and from microalgae lipids (Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella protothecoides) into biodiesel. Under the conditions tested (temperature: 120 degrees C, autogenous pressure, reaction time: 60 min, methanol to lipid ratio: 0.57 mL/g and 2.5 wt% Amberlyst-15 relative to microalgae lipids), Chlorella protothecoides lipids allowed to reach a higher conversion (84%) compared to Scenedesmus obliquus lipids (34%). However, the study showed that both microalgae lipids suffered from mass transfer limitations, due to impurities, because FFAs conversions higher than 90% were obtained with the model oils (20-33 wt% FFAs in canola oil). Despite the fact that the FFAs from both microalgae were suitable to produce biodiesel, further studies must be made on alkali transesterification of the remaining lipids still present in microalgae biodiesel and on crude lipid purification in order to limit the mass transfer problems.

Holm oak was used as real lignocellulosic biomass to be treated. In the fractionation reactor, hemicellulose and cellulose were solubilized and partially hydrolyzed in different stages with the aim of feeding the hydrolysis reactor with high C5 or C6 concentrations respectively. The fractionation was performed in two stages: at 180 degrees C optimizing the hemicellulose extraction and at 260 degrees C extracting cellulose and hard hemicellulose remaining in the biomass structure. Three water flows were tested: 11, 17 and 26 cm(3)/min. Sugar yields from 71 to 75% were reached, mainly composed of xylose and glucose oligomers and lower amounts of other chemicals, like retro-aldol products, acetic acid or 5-HMF. The outlet stream from the fractionation reactor was directly mixed with sub or supercritical water at the inlet mixer of a supercritical hydrolysis reactor where the reaction time was precisely controlled. The temperature, pressure and reaction time were modified to get an insight of their effect on the yield of retro-aldol condensation products. Yields of 24% for glycolaldehyde, and pyruvaldehyde were found at 83 s, 350 degrees C and 162 bar (hydrolysis reactor conditions). On other hand, 25% of lactic acid was found at 0.23 s, 396 degrees C and 245 bar. A discussion based on a known reaction pathway is proposed. Moreover, a kinetic model for the hydrolysis reactor was put forward, being able to reproduce the experimental data with deviations below 10% for sugars and other products extracted.

The importance of predicting and optimizing selective ion rejections by NF not only of major compounds (e.g. NaCl, Na2SO4, MgCl2, MgSO4) but also of minor ones such as ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), bromide (Br-), iodide (I-) typically present in natural and industrial process streams is crucial. The current work explores ion rejection patterns and membrane ion permeances using the phenomenological Solution-Electro-Diffusion-Film (SEDF) model. It makes possible rapid calculations that account for the effects of spontaneously arising electric fields on rejections. Experimental ion rejection data of several inorganic ions species at various transmembrane pressures and at fixed cross-flow velocity have been obtained with NF270 membrane. A number of trace ions (Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, Brand I-) have been used in combination with various dominant salts (NaCl, MgCl2, MgSO4) as model feed solutions. Results showed that dominant salts were moderately (NaCl) and highly (MgCl2, MgSO4) rejected when some ions are divalent, while trace ions exhibited quite variable rejection, including negative ones mainly at low transmembrane volume flows. The electric field of membrane potential can accelerate or retard the ion flows to the permeate, so negative or unexpectedly high rejections could be observed. Ions transport was shown to be affected by the membrane chemistry (e.g. acid-base properties of the un-crosslinked carboxylic and amine groups) and the dielectric exclusion phenomena. From the modelling procedure, ionic membrane permeances were determined for various multi-ion systems studied. Results showed that nature of dominant salt composition can be used to control the rejection of minor components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,308,9,ED7YG,2019/1/29

Every channel in the experimental MCR was 1 mm in diameter, 10 mm in height and was filled with an industrial Fe-Mo catalyst ground to a fraction of 0.15-0.25 mm. Methanol concentration in the feed mixture was 6.5 and 12 mol%, oxygen to methanol molar ratio was 1.5, the temperature was in the range 240-360 degrees C. Safe processing of the reaction in MCR at methanol concentration as high as 12 mol% makes it possible to reach approximately a 10-fold increase in the specific formaldehyde productivity per unit volume of the catalyst even within the explosive range of oxygen-methanol mixtures. Numerical simulation of the process by use of a continuum model revealed its sufficient consistency with the experimental results. It was shown that methanol conversion decreased by similar to 12% after operation for 100 h at 300 degrees C and 12 mol% of methanol. In contrast, at the same conditions but at standard 6.5 mol% of methanol, the decrease in the conversion did not exceed 3%.

The main operating parameters of each process were investigated on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. The results showed that the combination of PM, EF and SR processes could provide the discharge standard in a way that COD was reduced from 1450 to 62 mg/L. Moreover, the biodegradability of effluents obtained from EF and SR was improved. As an important result, pH of the wastewater was adjusted for one time at first process (PM) and final effluent reached neutral condition. Phytotoxicity of the effluents obtained in each process was evaluated by germination index. Their results showed that phytotoxicity was dramatically reduced for four plants species in final effluent.

The VUV/UV process was more efficient to degrade ITC than sole UV process and the photodegradation rate was an order of magnitude higher. A relatively higher pH favored ITC photodegradation under both IN and VUV/UV irradiations. The effects of Fe(II/III) on TTC degradation under VUV/UV or sole UV irradiation were controlled by different reaction mechanisms. Fe(III) could promote TTC degradation under sole UV irradiation by complexation and subsequent oxidation, where the ITC degradation rate reached the maximum value ((14.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(-3) min(-1)) at a Fe(III):TTC molar ratio of 1:1. The promotion of TTC degradation by Fe(III) under VUV/UV light can be negligible because of the dominated role of (OH)-O-center dot radicals produced by VUV/UV irradiation in TTC degradation. In contrast, Fe(II) facilitated TTC degradation under VUV/UV irradiation due to the additional (OH)-O-center dot radicals formed by the potential Fenton process. However, there was no obvious enhancement of ITC degradation with the addition of Fe(II) under sole UV irradiation.

However, the startup way of thermophilic digester is very critical as unsuitable startup ways may lead to inefficiency of the system. In this study, the experimental temperatures were set at 37 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 52 degrees C respectively by step increase strategy in order to culture thermophilic microbial organisms involved in anaerobic TA degradation. The performance and microbial community profiles of PTA wastewater treatment system were investigated under different operational temperatures using 454-pyrosequencing approach. During the step temperature increase process, 37 degrees C was proved to be the most favorable operational temperature with a highest COD removal of 96.10(+/- 1.58)%, but with undergoing 43 degrees C, COD removal decreased to 90.42. (+/- 2.65)%, and 52 degrees C seemed to be the worst as it achieved only 70.08(+/- 5.46)% COD reduction. Stepwise temperature increase is tested not very appropriate to culture thermophilic microorganism for TA degradation as prospective. Furthermore, during startup stage, the predominant bacteria family shifted from Syntrophorhabdaceae (belonging to delta-proteobacteria) at 37 degrees C to Comamonadaceae (belonging to beta-proteobacteria) at 43 degrees C and OPB95 (belonging to OP8) at 52 degrees C.

Sewage sludge was first torrefied in an auger reactor under two different conditions: temperature of 250 degrees C and 275 degrees C and average solid residence times of 13 min and 24 min, respectively. Pyrolysis was conducted at 530 degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor. The catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors was carried out in a fixed bed reactor using gamma-alumina (gamma-Al2O3) as a catalyst. The experimental results showed that the combination of the torrefaction pre-treatment with the catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors did not noticeably improved the properties of the liquid organic phases for use as a fuel, in terms of O/C molar ratio and nitrogen content, compared to pyrolysis of sewage sludge with the same catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors but without the torrefaction pre-treatment. Generally, the torrefaction did not have effect on the type of chemical families identified in the liquid phases and had little effect on the proportion of these families. The advantages of the combination of treatments were, on the one hand, the catalyst saving resulting from the lower amount of vapors generated by the pyrolysis of torrefied sewage sludge and, on the other hand, the slight decrease in the coke yield.

Studying on electrocatalytic activity revealed that the presence of CoS2 nanoparticles along with MWCNTs and Pt nanoparticles played a prominent role in enhancement of proton reduction to hydrogen gas. The possible mechanism of electrocatalytic activity by nanocomposite films is also discussed. The PPy(CoS2)MWCNTsPt nanocomposite film exhibits extremely low overpotential (0.03 V vs. RHE), and high current density for HER in acidic solution. The activity enhancement can be attributed to the large active electrochemical surface area of MWCNTs and also porous structure of PPy provides excellent attachment of CoS2 and Pt nanostructures to the matrix. In addition, the HER is further improved due to stronger adsorption of hydrogen to the disulfide anions in CoS2 structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,308,14,ED7YG,2019/2/15

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

However, it always takes several months to start up a biofilm filter. In this study, by oxidizing manganese and ferrous ion from raw water using potassium permanganate continuously, an iron manganese co-oxide filter film (MeOx) was formed quicldy on the surface of virgin quartz sand in a pilot scale filter, and the start-up period was less than 30 days. Interestingly, 90% ammonium and manganese could be removed by the filter film even after the bacteria were inactivated completely in both the filter film and raw water (by aerating ozone and injecting hydrogen peroxide), suggesting that microorganisms may play a negligible role in our system. Additionally, the filter film exhibited high oxidation activity when the temperature was down to 6.6 degrees C. The filter film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods. Finally, a chemical catalytic oxidation mechanism for ammonium removal was proposed by the analysis of the oxidation process. Ammonium was oxidized to nitrate through the process of catalytic oxidation, generating hydrogen ions. MeOx plays as a catalyst, and the intermediates O-center dot can potentially serve as both oxidant and reductant in one-electron-transfer reactions with NH4+ and O-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it was greatly inhibited with the increase of pH, especially at basic condition (pH(0) = 9.0). This was probably due to the precipitation of the ferrous ions leached from the surface of MNP. In addition, hydroxyl radical was found to dominate the degradation process at acidic condition while both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals contributed to the degradation at neutral condition. Except the leached form, the structural ferrous ion on the surface of MNP also participated in the activation process through the redox reactions, as illustrated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.

To date, biological treatment has been employed before it is released into water bodies to minimize the environmental hazards. However, the dark brownish colour of the effluent is still a big challenge to be addressed. In regard to this concern, membrane separation can serve as an attractive solution for this issue. This paper aims to investigate the performance of ultrafiltration nanocomposite membrane embedded with coupled zinc-iron oxide (ZIO) for the decolourization of POME. The ZIO was synthesized through the solution combustion technique by employing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as the precursors and urea as the fuel. The nanocomposite flat sheet membrane was prepared via phase inversion process. The physico-chemical properties of the MMMs were analysed using zeta potential analysis, SEM, BET and contact angle. Continuous filtration test was carried out to evaluate the capability of the MMMs for colour and COD removal. The results showed that the increase in the ZIO loading has drastically increased the membrane surface negativity and led to the colour removal of 70%. In addition, with the addition of M0.5, the permeation and colour removal had increased 25% and 17% respectively, compared to the pristine PVDF membrane. However, the long term filtration test revealed that the structure of M0.5 collapsed after 4 cycles of washing, but M2.0 still retained its performance. In a nutshell, this study demonstrated that negative surface charge has improved the antifouling properties meanwhile hydrophilicity has contributed to increased water flux during the colour removal process.

The raw date pits (RDPs) surface images showed a marked difference in pore sizes upon roasting, whilst FTIR spectra showed a slight shifting in -O-H, C=O, and -C-O stretching in addition to -O-H bending for the RODPs. In addition to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models, the experimental data were fitted to different adsorption kinetic models. It was found that the adsorption of Br- onto RODPs followed pseudo-second order mechanism. Removal rates of around 54% were obtained at lower pH. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A hydrothermal treatment was applied to grow a layer of zeolite X over diatomite and carbon surfaces. The hierarchically porous composites used for Mn2+ ion removal showed higher ion-exchange capacity when compared to pure zeolite X under same conditions. A thermodynamic study of the rate of ion-exchange revealed that the intra-particle diffusion rate constant of zeolite X/carbon and zeolite X/diatomite was higher than that of pure zeolite X indicating that the intra-particle diffusion was enhanced when zeolite was prepared in form of hierarchically porous composites. The study showed that the thickness of boundary film of zeolite X/carbon and zeolite X/diatomite was less than that of pure zeolite X indicating ion diffusion resistance to the active sites was reduced when the composites were utilised. The experimental data showed good agreement with Freundlich model. The calculated thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees indicated the ion-exchange process of Mn2+ ion by zeolite X and its composites was spontaneous, endothermic and the randomness increased at the liquid/solid interface under the conditions studied. The results of kinetic study showed that the ion-exchange of Mn2+ ion by zeolite X and its composites followed a pseudo second order kinetic model indicating Mn2+ ion removal is a chemical reaction related to valence forces. The encapsulation of Mn2+ ion was successfully achieved by vitrification and geopolymerization processes demonstrating the efficacy of both processes for environmental management.

Intermediates formation and biodegradability assessment,English,Article,"In this work, the use of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) against the degradation of an emerging contaminant has been subjected under systematic investigation. The optimization of treatment of the antidepressant drug Venlafaxine (VFA) was performed, using UV light, the combined UV/H2O2 process, solar light, Fenton and finally the solar photo-Fenton process in laboratory scale. The degradation kinetics, the time necessary to remove 90% of the contaminant and the optimal reactants concentration were proposed. The treatment in pure water, (synthetic) wastewater and urine was assessed, in an effort to identify the opportunities and pitfalls the application of process would encounter in a field application. Treatment by the UV-based methods was found sufficiently efficient and the application of the solar photo-Fenton process showed feasibility in a potential field application with appropriate context. Real urban wastewater effluents after biological and physicochemical treatment were tested, as well as human urine, as a proposal for on-site collection and treatment was also treated. Biological treatment before applying the tested AOPs improved their efficiency, and the strategy of diluting urine prior to treatment greatly enhanced the efficacy of the process. Finally, the identification of the degradation pathway and the biodegradability tests of AOPs treated VFA solutions exhibit promising results concerning the strategy of treatment for similar pollutants of emerging concern.

Among three different Co3O4 catalysts tested, Co3O4-KITE displayed the best catalytic activity in PMS solution, achieving almost complete removal of 30 mu M chloramphenicol within 60 min at the reaction conditions of 0.1 g L-1 catalyst and 1.0 mM peroxymonosulfate. The superior catalytic performance of Co3O4-KIT6 was ascribed to the combination of multiple unique characteristics, including the large specific surface area, high pore volume, high Co2+ content and high density of surface active sites. Several factors played important roles in controlling the degradation of chloramphenicol. Higher catalyst dosage, higher PMS concentration, neutral pH and higher reaction temperature favored the removal. The balance among Co2+/Co3+, O2-/O-2 and PMS decomposed in solution ensured the continuous generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals, and the latter made the predominant contribution for the CAP degradation. Considering its outstanding catalytic activity, excellent reusability and long-term stability, ordered mesoporous Co3O4 should be an ideal catalyst for environmental application.

To solve this problem, water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and polyethyleneimine (PEI) modification were proposed as efficacious means for improving its CO2 sorption capacity and mitigating the sorbent deactivation in these acid impurities. CO2 sorption performances of the pretreated and modified sorbents were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor under simulated ECLSS conditions of 20 degrees C, 1.0% CO2, 2.0% H2O, 30 ppm SO2, 20 ppm NO2 and balanced N-2. The mechanisms for sorbent deactivation inhibition by water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and PEI modification were revealed by N-2 adsorption desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Effects of water vapor pretreatment duration, KOH addition and PEI loading on sorbent deactivation inhibition performances were demonstrated.

The membrane surface chemical composition was characterized by ATR-FTIR and XPS. The membrane morphology was observed by FESEM, AFM and BET measurements. The effects of BSR content on boron adsorption properties were studied in detail. Addition of BSR leads to rougher and more hydrophilic membrane surface and higher permeation flux. The boron uptake increases obviously with the BSR content and has the maximum over 2.0 mmol/g. The membrane shows S-type isotherm and the adsorption kinetics can be well described by the pseudo-first-order model.

Results show that the produced H2O2 and the reactive electrons releasing from metal aluminum were the primary electron donors for the preferable Cr(VI) reduction in anaerobic SZVAI/Cr(VI)/oxalate system. The reduction rate of Cr(VI) decreased with the increase of both initial pH value of 1.5-4.5 and Cr(VI) initial concentration of 50-300 mu M increased with oxalate concentration from 0 to 4.0 mM, and markedly retarded under anaerobic condition due to the completely inhibited H2O2 production. Notably, the accelerated Cr(VI) reduction induced by oxalate can be ascribed to the fact that the affinity of oxalate to Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species resulted in the expansion of Cr(VI)/Cr(V) coordination from tetrahedron to hexahedron, which was preferred for hexahedral Cr(III) species. Consequently, the presence of oxalate can significantly accelerate Cr(VI) reduction rate, and acted as an alternative electron donor simultaneously for Cr(VI) reduction through intramolecular electron transfer reaction. As compared with zero-valent aluminum (ZVAI), SZVAI exhibited superior reducing capacity for Cr(VI) reduction due to the presence of numerous galvanic cells in SZVAI corrosion process. The appreciable treatment efficiency of real chrome electroplating effluent indicates SZVAI/oxalate system presents as a preferable case of ""waste control by waste"" strategy. Moreover, the present study provided a new perspective on the role of oxalate in Cr(VI) reduction, which was significant in the detoxification of Cr (VI) process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Commercialization of this process depends on the development of suitable membrane modules. The earlier studies were performed on flat sheet membranes. Hollow fiber modules seem to be the most suitable module for this process on account of high packing density for handling the large amount gasoline-stream in the refineries. In this study, a mathematical model is derived for determining the performance of axial flow type hollow fiber module. The experiment could not be performed on hollow fiber module due to unavailability of commercial modules. However, tubular modules are commercially available. Tubular and hollow fiber modules have similar geometry, and their mathematical models are also the same. Therefore, for the model validation, experiments are carried out on a commercially available tubular module for removal of thiophene from n-heptane/thiophene model gasoline. Furthermore, the experimental results from the literature for the ethanol/water separation are also used for model validation. The mathematical model is successfully validated in both cases. Since the performance of membrane modules also depends on different dimensional parameters related to module geometry, the performances of the hollow fiber module are determined by varying these parameters. Simulations show that lower membrane area, lower length/diameter ratio of module, higher module porosity and lower fiber radius leads to improvement in the module performances. Furthermore, the performance of module is compared for both co-current and counter-current flow arrangements, which shows that the values of average fluxes are higher for counter-current flow arrangement. These results suggest that for given conditions, counter-current hollow fiber module is a better option than the co-current hollow fiber module. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Extraction of Cd and Ag with Aliquat (R) 336 was enhanced by Cl- in the sample, but it was independent of the concentration of organic matter. Extraction yield varied in the range 65-80% for Ag, and 45-95% for Cd, depending on the salinity of samples. The highest extraction was obtained in seawater samples for 75% Aliquat (R) 336 dissolved in kerosene with 18% dodecan-1-ol, after 45 min, and 800 rpm stirring rate in the sample.

Both SPC and SEPC meso-tubes were capable of delivering a near plug flow behaviour and the values of axial dispersion coefficient (D-c) estimated for the solids were in the range of 1.0-2.2 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-1). In contrast, the minimum (critical) fluid oscillation conditions required for full suspension of particles varied significantly, in general with the SPC tubes requiring up to 50% lower amplitude for full particles suspension. Overall, alpha revealed the dominant parameter in controlling solids backmixing, and the inner tube geometry requiring the lowest energy input for homogenous particle suspension and minimum D-c (i.e. sharpest residence time distribution) presented a l/d = 3, d(0) = 0.35d, alpha = 12% and SPC design. This study is believed to support the future design of optimised meso-scale OFR systems for continuous screening and manufacturing of value-added liquid -solid and multi -phase systems, such as catalytic and crystallisation processes.

It is a very meaningful work to respectively separate a few trace phenolic compounds from their aqueous solution by foam fractionation. The studies of surface activity and surface excess revealed that catechol had a stronger competitive adsorption on the bubble surface than phenol by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a collector. A two-stage batch foam fractionation technology was developed for the respective separation of catechol and phenol from their diluted aqueous solution. In the first stage batch foam fractionation, catechol was effectively separated with a high enrichment ratio of 32.2 and a high removal percentage of 90.25% while the removal percentage of phenol was only 2.32% under the suitable operating conditions. A high selectivity coefficient of catechol over phenol could reach 35.25. Then, phenol existed in the residual solution, which was used as the feeding solution in the second stage. In the second stage batch foam fractionation, the small bubbles were used to enhance the adsorption of phenol. At the same time, the foam fractionation column of an inclined foam phase was used to enhance foam drainage and then phenol was effectively removed with a high enrichment ratio of 44.4 and a high removal percentage of 90.23% under the suitable operating conditions. The results indicated that it was practicable to successfully and respectively separate catechol and phenol from their aqueous solution by using the two-stage batch foam fractionation.

This study aimed to assess the influence of hydraulic flow direction (down-flow or up flow) and substrate type (brick rubble or oyster shell) on removal of antibiotics and ARGs from swine wastewater. For antibiotic removal, all of treatments can remove more than 84% of oxytetracycline and difloxacin during two stages of operation. Brick-based columns had stronger antibiotic removal capacity due to properties of brick, including large porosity and micropore size and 32% of Fe2O3. The surface soils tended to adsorb much more oxytetracycline than difloxacin, as was opposite to brick and oyster shell. For ARGs removal, the removal efficiencies of tetracycline-resistance genes (tet) and integrase gene of Class 1 integrons ranged from 33.2 to 99.1%, without significant difference among treatments (p > 0.05). However, most of Sigma tet relative abundances in effluents of up-flow treatments were higher than those in influents, which indicated a risk to release relatively more antibiotic-resistant bacteria in proportion to total bacteria into environment. Significantly correlated with antibiotic concentrations, ARGs relative abundances in surface soils increased as the time progressed for all the treatments. Our results demonstrate that antibiotic removal using constructed wetlands is greatly affected by substrate type, whereas variation of ARG relative abundances in effluents and soils are determined by hydraulic flow direction.

The efficiency of Cd(II) ions removal can be expected at 100% for an initial Cd(II) concentration of 50 mg L-1, compared with the efficiencies of 91.2 and 83.6% for the initial Cd(II) concentrations of 100 and 200 mg L-1, respectively, after 3-h reaction time under sunlight irradiation. The desorption capacities of Cd(II) ions in TPVA-ABs were verified for five consecutive cycles of adsorption/desorption to be less than 3% of the reduced Cd (II) ion removal efficiency.

However, the mechanism and relevant kinetic steps involved in this reaction remain unclear. In this study, the catalytic ozonation of toluene over MnO2/graphene was investigated using the empirical power law model and classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood single-site (denoted as L-H5) mechanism. The apparent activation energy determined using the power law model was 29.3 +/- 2.5 kJ mol(-1). This finding indicated that the catalytic ozonation of toluene over MnO2/graphene was a heterogeneous reaction, and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism was applicable. However, the L-H5 mechanism did not fit the experimental data, suggesting that the reaction was non-single-site governed. A novel Langmuir-Hinshelwood dual-site (denoted as L-H-d) mechanism was then proposed to explain the experimental observations of the catalytic ozonation of toluene over MnO2/graphene through a steady-state kinetic study. This mechanism was based on the hypothesis that MnO2 was responsible for ozone decomposition and toluene adsorption on graphene; these two types of adsorption were coupled by an adjacent attack. Furthermore, XPS results confirmed the presence of a strong connection between MnO2 and graphene sites on the surface of MnO2/graphene. This connection allowed the adjacent attack and validated the dual-site mechanism. The L-Hd model was consistent with the predicted reaction rate of toluene removal with a correlation coefficient near unity (r(2) = 0.9165). Moreover, the physical criterion was in accordance with both enthalpy and entropy of toluene adsorption constraints. Fulfillment of mathematical and physical criteria indicated the catalytic ozonation of toluene over MnO2/graphene can be well described by the L-Hd mechanism. This study helps understand the catalytic ozonation of toluene over MnO2/graphene in a closely mechanistic view. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,308,9,ED7YG,2019/3/27

The resulting extractant impregnated hollow fiber membranes (EIHFM) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water entry pressure, gas permeability and mercury porosimetry analysis, all of which showed significant structural and morphological changes in the EIHFMs; pore size, porosity and tortuosity were estimated to be 0.5 mu m, 0.09 and 33, respectively. The EIHFMs exhibited high mass transfer rates and removal efficiency during simultaneous extraction and stripping of phenol. At an initial phenol concentration of 200 mg/L, 99% phenol was extracted from the wastewater within 7 h, whereas more than 91% phenol was recovered in the stripping solution, yielding a concentration factor of 1.79. The performance of the EIHFMs did not change significantly during consequent operations under identical conditions, indicating the stability of impregnation.

However, a number of discrepancies can be found in the past literature about the reaction mechanism and the kinetic behaviour of the system. In the present investigation, by running the reaction in a batch system under homogenous conditions, a radical mechanism was ruled out and experimental evidence of an ionic reaction network was provided. No induction period was found possibly due to a low amount of nitrous acid produced by dissociation of concentrated nitric acid. The reaction rate is significantly increased by the addition of sulfuric acid. A mathematical model is proposed based on benzyl nitrite as the key intermediate which is in equilibrium with benzyl alcohol and irreversibly decomposes with a significant yield of benzaldehyde. The model is capable to predict the behaviour of the reacting homogeneous phase system at varying initial conditions. The estimated kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are reported. The kinetic modelling carried out in this work would also be relevant to run the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in other reactor schemes, such as continuous flow (micro) reactors.

Taking advantage of this structural property, the conversion method of lignin into resin material was developed in this study. Depolymerization of lignin is one of the most important factors for utilizing the basic frameworks of phenylpropanoids. Lignin is extractable from lignocellulosic biomass using acetone-water binary solution. Therefore, the simultaneous extraction and depolymerization of lignin under high temperature and high pressure from Japanese cedar was examined. Prior to the extraction process, cedar was treated with 50 wt% formic acid at 175 degrees C for the saccharification of hemicellulose and part of cellulose which could be contaminants in resin material. Next, the lignin extraction was conducted using 30 wt% of acetone at the higher""temperature of 295 degrees C and 0.82 g/(g-lignin in material) was obtained. The curing property of the obtained sample was evaluated by differential thermal analysis and the detected exothermic energy during resinification was 18.2 mu V/mg. In addition, it was confirmed by visual observation that the obtained sample resinified uniformly by heating at 150 degrees C. Thus, the effective production method of usable lignin-based resin was developed.

Shear rheological investigations proved that the MFCs had dramatically improved melt elasticities compared with the pure PLA. The crystallization kinetics of the PLA was also significantly improved after the microfibrillation process which was attributed to the heterogeneous crystal nucleation effects of the microfibrils.

Nevertheless, most of the available reduction processes are feasible at acidic pHs only, and very few technologies are capable of reducing Cr(VI) at alkaline pHs. Herein, we demonstrated that the UV/sulfite process is very promising for alkaline Cr(VI) remediation, including the Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) and simultaneous Cr(III) precipitation. In this process Cr(VI) reduction followed near zero-order kinetics, declining with an increase of pH (5-10) but boosting with increasing sulfite concentration. The co-existing Cl- and SO42- in water exerted negligible effect on Cr (VI) reduction, whereas the reduction kinetics was improved in the presence of citrate, EDTA or humic acid possibly due to their complexation with Cr(III). Similarly, the presence of borate buffer would significantly inhibit Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) as well as the final Cr(III) removal during precipitation. Fortunately, the presence of calcium ions even at trace level would favor Cr(III) precipitation and result in one-step removal of the total Cr at alkaline pH. The mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction was probed through irradiation manipulation and N2O addition, and the results suggested that excitation of sulfite is essential for alkaline Cr(VI) reduction, and e(aq) is the dominant reactive species in the UV/sulfite process.

The OTMs were tested and evaluated under twenty consecutive methane reduction/air oxidation cycles. Several solid-state kinetic models were consecutively and optimally screened for each OTM at different redox cycles. The use of different supports resulted in different forms of the redox kinetics. NiO/Al2O3 and NiO/TiO2 reduction kinetics were rate-determined by chemical reaction and fitted via the Unreacted Shrinking Core Model. On the other hand, NiO/ZrO2 and NiO/SiO2 reduction was found to proceed via nucleation and subsequent nuclei growth and was suitably described with Avrami-Erofeev models. The use of different types of kinetic models is attributed to differences in strength of metal-support interactions. Specifically, the strong interaction between NiO and Al2O3 and TiO2 creates NM-support interfaces where Ni nuclei are formed very fast, rendering the chemical reaction the governing step of the reduction process. When NiO is supported on SiO2 and ZrO2, the interaction is weak and NiO basically behaves like free NiO, reducing via the slow formation of homogeneous nuclei on the surface and the subsequent faster growth of Ni domains.

The rate of fouling for the BMRSP was always lower than a corresponding control system. For a given enzymatic concentration, a constant foulant hydrolyzing capacity is identified. At 3 g/m(2) pectinase containing bionanocomposites, the BMRSP hydrolytic efficiency was 1.5 g/m(2) h. This efficiency was further increased by increasing the amount of bionanocomposites per membrane area. This further allowed the BMRSP to hydrolyze higher loads of foulants while keeping a low if not zero increase in TMP over time at constant flux. Identification of an optimal operating condition laid the platform for continuous operation of the BMRSP over 200 h, without visible transmembrane pressure drift while maintaining constant flux. Product assay in the permeate gave constant value in the entire duration, i.e., no enzymatic activity decay owing to stable enzyme immobilization and no leakage through the pores of the membrane owing to the synergistic magnetic interaction between the magnetic membrane and magnetic bionanocomposites. The obtained stability over a broad range of operational parameters and sustainable performance over long period gives a high prospect to the newly developed BMRSP to be utilized in continuous biocatalysis and separation, thereby significantly improved process efficiency.

The waste-art-paper biochars obtained at higher temperature showed extraordinary removal of aqueous Pb(II) with the Langmuir maximum sorption capacity of 1555 mg g(-1), significantly higher than that of other carbon sorbents in literatures. Comparison of Pb(II) sorption onto biochar's deashing component and ash suggested the important role of minerals in Pb(II) sorption. The pH changes and the releases of Ca2+ after Pb(II) sorption further suggested the reactions between calcite minerals of the biochars with the lead ion during Pb(II) sorption. Characterizations of pristine and post-sorption biochars with scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron analyses confirmed the precipitation of Pb(II) with CO32- to form PbCO3 and Pb-2(OH)(2)CO3 crystals on the biochar surfaces. As a result, acid extraction (1.0 mol L-1 HNO3) effectively recycled all the sorbed lead. Furthermore, incineration of Pb(II)-laden biochar under 350 degrees C not only successfully recovered the lead but also turned it into high purity (>96%) PbO nanoparticles. Findings from this work indicated that recycle waste art paper for biochar production can be a promising environmentally friendly and cost-effective technology because of the extraordinary sorption ability of waste-art-paper biochar and the effective recovery of sorbed Pb(II) into value-added nanoparticles from exhausted biochar.

In the presence of Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires, bromate was reduced to Br- efficiently with the generation of HOBr intermediates. Bromide species analyses and nanowires characterizations indicated that surface bound ferrous ions of core-shell Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires could effectively promote the BrO3- removal. Meanwhile, molecular oxygen competed electrons from both Fe2+ and Fe-0 to generate reactive oxygen species of O-center dot(2)-, H2O2, and OH during the bromate removal process. Among the generated reactive oxygen species, O-center dot(2)- and H2O2 favored of bromate removal, but 'OH inhibited. We proposed a bromate removal mechanism with core-shell Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires, which suggested that the effect of surface bound Fe (II) and molecular oxygen was taken into consideration when using nZVI for bromate remediation in waters.

However, the relatively large crystallite size of Ag3PO4 lowers its light response, while the high conduction band potential intensifies the reduction to Ag by the light induced electron, limiting the practical application of Ag3PO4. To overcome these drawbacks, we herein adopted a facile liquid phase deposition method to load Ag3PO4 onto amino-modified biochar which is an abundant and cheap byproduct of biomass pyrolysis to prepare renewable energy. The as-prepared composite (Ag/Ag3PO4/AMB) exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance to amoxicillin degradation compared with pure Ag3PO4. The results show that almost 80% amoxicillin was decomposed in 120 min in the presence of Ag/Ag3PO4/AMB, whereas only 65% of the amoxicillin was degraded with pure Ag3PO4. Multiple characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), MR, Raman, and XPS revealed that Ag3PO4 particles were evenly distributed on the surface of biochar, and a few Ag NPs were also generated due to the reduction effect of AMB. IJV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis revealed that the composite had good visible light response, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicated AMB improved the efficiency of charge separation and electron transfer. In addition, EPR determination suggested that the oxidant formed in photocatalysis systems under visible light irradiation plays an important role in the degradation of amoxicillin.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate heterogeneous mercury oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface. The results indicate that Hg-0 is chemically adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 0 0) surface with an adsorption energy of -60.82 kJ/mol. HCl can decompose on MnFe2O4 surface to form active surface chlorine species for mercury oxidation. Both intermediate (HgCl) and final (HgCl2) products are adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 00) surface in a dissociative adsorption manner. Hg-0 oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism in which a bimolecular reaction occurs between adsorbed Hg and active surface chlorine species. The mercury oxidation process over MnFe2O4 surface was investigated by examining the energy profile of reaction pathway. Heterogeneous Hg-0 oxidation by HCl occurs through a two-step reaction pathway (Hg-0 -> HgCl -> HgCl2) in which the first step (Hg-0 -> HgCl) is the rate-determining step. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work, we have characterized gas-liquid flow in a pseudo 2D bubble column for a wide range of superficial gas velocities (U-G = 1-30 cm.s(-1)) that cover dilute to dense flow conditions. In-house developed voidage probes were used to measure local gas volume fraction fluctuations, which in turn were used to characterize dynamics of column-scale re-circulatory flow and bubble-scale flow processes, under dilute-to-dense conditions. Importantly, the spatial distribution of internal composition of gas volume fraction, i.e. gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups, was measured. Further, the spatial distribution of chord length and bubble size was measured for a wide range of U-G. With increase in U-G, the low frequency oscillations caused by meandering bubble plume at lower U-G were found to diminish and the fluctuations caused by bubble swarms were found to dominate under the dense flow conditions. Using the time spent by the probe in each bubble, the bubble population was classified into different size groups and the gas volume fraction for each size group was measured. Under dense flow conditions, small bubbles were seen to accumulate near column walls, as exhibited by wall peaking in gas volume fraction profiles and that large bubbles were found to flow through the column centre. The results presented in this work are important to improve the understanding of dense gas-liquid flow and also for rigorous validation of CFD models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is essential to have good understanding of the mass transfer characteristics and gas distribution in airlift reactors to be able to design effective reactors and to optimize aeration conditions. To accomplish this goal, experimental studies on the mass transfer characteristics, i.e. gas holdup, bubble size, interfacial area, volumetric mass transfer coefficient and liquid-side mass transfer coefficient were performed in an annulus-rising airlift reactor with Newtonian and non Newtonian fluids. A 3D electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique was used to measure local gas holdup and visualize gas distribution. The influences of aeration rate and liquid viscosity on local gas holdup and interfacial area were investigated at three axial positions along the riser. The EIT results show that the uniformity of gas distribution reduces with increasing liquid viscosity. Bubble size was observed to have a bimodal distribution in highly viscous liquids at high gas superficial velocities due to the intensified coalescence and breakup of bubbles. The maximum value of the local interfacial area is found at the fully developed flow zone in the riser. The liquid-side mass transfer coefficient was found to depend on liquid viscosity and bubble size for non-Newtonian liquids. Empirical correlations based on the experimental data obtained in this work predict well the local gas holdup and volumetric mass transfer coefficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The approach is based on an original concept: the analysis of the probability that a photon entering the reaction volume is absorbed by the actinometer. Whereas this probability is assumed to be equal to one in classical actinometry, this assumption can no longer be satisfied in many practical situations in which optical thicknesses are low. Here we remove this restriction by using most recent advances in the field of radiative transfer Monte Carlo, in order to rigorously evaluate the instantaneous absorption probability as a function of conversion. Implementation is performed in EDStar, an open-source development environment that enables straightforward simulation of reactors with any geometry (directly provided by their CAD-file), with the very same Monte Carlo algorithm. Experimental investigations are focused on Reinecke salt photodissociation in two reactors designed for the study of natural and artificial photosynthesis. The first reactor investigated serves as reference configuration: its simple torus geometry allows to compare flux densities measured with quantum sensors and actinometry. Validations and analysis are carried out on this reactor. Then, the approach is implemented on a 25 L photobioreactor with complex geometry corresponding to one thousand light-diffusing optical fibers distributing incident photons within the reaction volume. Results show that classical actinometry neglecting radiative transfer can lead to 50 percent error when measuring incident flux density for such reactors. Finally, we show how this radiative transfer approach paves the way for analyzing high conversion as a mean to investigate angular distribution of incident photons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

All the materials were characterized from a morphological, spectroscopic, thermal, dynamic-mechanical (DMA) and mechanical point of view. For all the nanocomposites, the interphase was studied either by analyzing loss factor plots coming from DMA measurements and by implementing a novel approach, i.e. combining solvent extraction, SEM and EDX measurements. While GO and GO+S showed an almost negligible effect on the macroscopic features of PA6, due to lack of dispersion, PA6-GOS ternary nanocomposites displayed an outstanding enhancement of mechanical and thermo-mechanical performance. This feature is likely due to the formation of an extended and strong interphase. In fact, the silica layers intercalated between GO lamellae played as an exfoliating agent, thus proving to be particularly efficient in avoiding self-aggregation of GO sheets, while those covalently attached to basal planes of GO acted as a rivet, capable to interlock the surrounding polymer chains.

The composites were characterized by various techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurement through nitrogen adsorption at cryogenic temperature. Single component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were performed at different temperatures. The selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). MOF505@GO composites showed higher porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption compared to its parent compound MOF-505. MOF-505@5G0 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 3.94 mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa, having an increase of 37.3% in comparison with the parent MOF-505. The significant improvement of CO2 uptakes could be attributed to not only new micropores and unsaturated metal sites formed in the MOF505@GO, but also enhanced surface dispersive forces of the composites. The experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were well fitted with dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model. The CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 adsorption selectivities were up to 8.6 and 37.2 at 298 K and 100 kPa, respectively, predicted by LAST. More strikingly, the composites showed excellent moisture stability, which was confirmed by PXRD analysis. These superior performances suggested that the MOF-505@GO composites are promising candidates for industrial CO2 capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,308,8,ED7YG,2019/5/1

Monoethanolamine, diethanolamine (DEA), and methyl-diethanolamine solutions were used as carbon dioxide absorbents, leading to CO2 loading values for the first absorption step of 0.4193, 0.3967, and 0.2814 (mol CO2/mol amine), respectively. After saturating 400 mL of each absorbent solution using 15 vol% carbon dioxide gas mixed with nitrogen, 100 mL of industrial wastewater was added to the mixture, resulting in the formation of inorganic metal carbonate salts. After a filtration step, the samples were dried and instrumental analyses including scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry were performed.

The optimum H2O2/TPH mass ratio was determined to be 0.35 at which the complete TPH removal of inlet TPH concentrations up to 4 g/L at HRT of 24 h, corresponding to the loading rate of 41cg TPH/m(3).d, was attained. The average COD removal efficiency at this loading rate was 96.7%. With increasing the inlet TPH concentration from 1 to 2.5 g/L, the biomass bacterial activity as dehydrogenase activity (DHA) increased from 7.5 to 27.1 mu g TF/g(biomass) d and remained almost unchanged with further increase of TPH concentration. The peroxidase activity (PA) remained high between 382 and 410 U/g(biomass). In addition, the complete removal of 1 TPH (88.7% COD removal) was observed at HRT of as small as 4 h (corresponding to the loading rate of 6 kg TPH/m3.d) under optimum H202/TPH mass ratio. With the decrease of HRT from 24 h to 4 h at the constant TPH concentration of 1 g/L the value of DHA remained between 24.4 and 28.4 mu g TF/g(biomass).d while the PA value increased from 287.9 to 394.4 U/g(biomass). Total production of biosurfactants was 131 mg/L (38 mg/L rhamnolipid and 93 mg/L surfactin) when the SCR was operated at TPH loading rate of 6 kg/m(3).d.

With the system pH value rising from 4.0 to 9.0, the total removal rate of Pb(II) without and with adding the biopolymer increased from 1.94% to 86.5% and from 32.2% to 95.4%, respectively. From the analyses of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS), the continuous dissociation and deprotonation of functional groups in the biopolymer with rising system pH value promoted the biosorption removal of Pb(II) via complexation and ion exchange. According to the three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectrum, two protein-like fluorescence peaks of A (Ex/Em = 280 nm/326-338 nm) and B (Ex/Em = 220-230 nm/324-338 nm) were identified in the biopolymer. The binding site numbers, which were obtained via fluorescence quenching titration experiments, increased first and then decreased with rising system pH value for both peaks A and B. Biosorption removal of Pb(II) was dominant under acid conditions, but biosorption and Pb(OH)(2) precipitation co-existed under neutral and alkaline conditions. The biosorption and the Pb(OH)(2) precipitation were interestingly found to interfere with each other under alkaline conditions. The decreases in both binding site number and biosorption removal rate indicated that Pb(OH)(2) precipitation excelled the biosorption in the competition of capturing Pb(II). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pyrite, the most common metal sulfide on Earth's surface, can supply abundant Fe2+ for persulfate activation. The role of the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in persulfate-pyrite systems however, is not fully understood. In this study, batch experiments were used to investigate p-chloroaniline (PCA) degradation by a pyrite-persulfate system. The effects of pyrite dosage, pH, temperature, air conditions (aerobic vs. anaerobic) and pyrite particle size on PCA degradation were examined. Radical detection was conducted using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. Results from the EPR spectra indicated that PCA degradation was achieved by sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical oxidation. Aerobic conditions were more beneficial to PCA degradation than anaerobic conditions due to the generated superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) that activated the per sulfate to produce more sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) PCA degradation also increased with higher pyrite doses and under acidic conditions (pH 3.0 and 5.0). PCA was removed completely at pH 3.0 after 60 min. Temperature increase from 10 to 50 degrees C significantly promoted PCA degradation. These findings provide new understanding of the mechanism involved in pyrite activation of persulfate which can be used to improve PCA degradation by pyrite-persulfate systems.

An attempt has been made here to collect and organize current literature and provide an insight to most topics of the ongoing scientific conversation on CFWs. Several issues are discussed such as applications, construction materials, vegetation species, mechanisms for pollutant removal and management strategies. Raw data were extracted from studies and were imposed to statistical analysis in order to reveal correlations (Spearman's r coefficient) between total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration reduction and several operational or design parameters, e.g., vegetation aerial coverage, water depth, initial loading, Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR) and Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). TN concentration reduction correlated well with initial loading (r = 0.841; p = 0.000; n = 28) and showed a lower correlation with HRT (r = 0.443; p = 0.013; n = 28), and negative correlations with depth (r = -0.690; p = 0.000; n = 28) and HLR (r = -0.528; p = 0.002; n = 28). NH4+-N and TP concentration reductions correlated positively with initial loading (r = 0.869; p = 0.000; n = 19 and r = 0.840; p = 0.000; n = 21), and negatively with depth (r = -0.812; p = 0.000; n = 19 and r = -0.773; p = 0.000; n = 21) and HLR (r = -0.608; p = 0.02; n = 19; and r = -0.558; p = 0.06; n = 21). As the depth factor relates to the percent of root coverage in the water column, the aforementioned negative correlation for TP, TN and NH4+ with depth could be interpreted as the rhizosphere effect. Multi-linear regression analysis was carried out for TN and TP removal, in an attempt to describe quantitatively TN and TP concentration reduction as function of design and operation parameters. CFWs seem to be an efficient technique for both wastewater treatment and natural water purification; however, further research is needed in order to better interpret system's behavior and optimize its efficiency.

This paper reports the specific generation of an electro-catalyst, Cu1+ in Cu2+[Ni2+(CN)(4)] heterometallic complex, and its catalytic reduction efficiency in the degradation of gaseous trichloroethylene (TCE). The oxidation/reduction potential (ORP) and the UV-visible spectral results revealed Cu1+ formation during the electrolysis of Cu2+[Ni2+(CN)(4)] in 10 M KOH instead of Ni1+. In addition, the electrochemical formation of Cu1+ (1.9 mM) while in a heterometallic complex was higher than that of the individual Cu2+ ion (0.47 mM). The electro-generated Cu1+[Ni2+(CN)(4)](1-) applied to the removal of gaseous TCE by electro-scrubbing showed almost 100% removal with a gas flow rate of up to 4 L min(-1), which is high enough for use on an industrial scale.

A pseudo 2D experimental setup was used, where porous plates on the back plate of column mimicked gas extraction through flat vertically inserted membranes. The maximum in the standard deviation of pressure fluctuations, commonly employed to indicate the transition to turbulent fluidization, shifted to lower fluidization velocities with an increase in the fraction of fluidizing gas being extracted. Flow visualization showed that this result is connected to the onset of stable densified zone formation, which occurred at progressively lower fluidization velocities as the gas extraction fraction was increased. It has also been found that the extent of densified zones quantified using instantaneous particle velocity maps collected by Ply increases with increasing gas extraction rates. This effect became larger for smaller particles. Results have therefore shown that the peak in pressure fluctuations in fluidized beds with gas extraction through flat vertical membranes indicates the onset of densified zones formation rather than turbulent fluidization. Such densified zones can have substantial detrimental effects (such as induced mass transfer limitations, gas bypass etc.) on the reactor performance and can be identified via pressure measurements, as illustrated in this work.

Confinement was provided with the use of a polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) tube and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrappings or FRP with a sandwiched layer of foam to enhance impact energy reduction due to potential FRP rupture and PVC fracture. In the present paper, additional flexural tests on CCFPT columns were undertaken to further investigate the structural behavior of the proposed system for column construction in seismic regions. Axial and flexural behavior of CCFPT columns was investigated with compressive and flexural tests, respectively, and compared with those of their corresponding concrete-filled polyvinyl-chloride tubular (CFPT) and FRP-wrapped (FW) columns. Test results obtained from 152 x 305 mm (6 x 12 in.) stub columns under axial loads and 152 x 1524 mm (6 x 60 in.) flexural beams under four-point loads indicated that the CCFPT columns can significantly enhance strength over the CFPT columns and enhance ductility over the FW columns. The transverse confining pressure from FRP wrapping and the interface property between the FRP and PVC proved critical in CCFPT design. Furthermore, the idea of introducing a cushioning foam layer between FRP layers and PVC to lessen the brittleness of FRP rupture in seismic regions proved effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At the meso-scale, concrete is modeled as a 3-phase composite material composed of mortar, interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and coarse aggregate. Each phase is further simplified as 2-phase composite material composed of matrix phase (zero porosity) and pore phase (the sum of various scale pores). Chloride permeability of concrete at low deformation is closely related to the porosity of concrete. Low stress changes the porosity of concrete thus influencing the chloride ion diffusion coefficient. Based on the theory of elasticity, an analytical model is developed, and a quantitative relationship is proposed between the external equivalent stress and the diffusion coefficient of the chloride ion as well as current-state porosity of mortar and the ITZ. The good agreement between the proposed model and the available test data illustrates that the proposed model is reliable and accurate. However, as the initial assumption was for elastic state, the model is valid for elastic low stress, or the accuracy of model reduces using plastic high stress state. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Most previous works examined the properties of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (GPC) subjected to curing at elevated temperature. To extend the use of GPC in cast-in-situ applications, this paper investigated the properties of blended low-calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete cured in ambient condition. Geopolymer concretes were produced using low calcium fly ash with a small percentage of additive such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), ordinary Portland cement (OPC) or hydrated lime to enhance early age properties. Samples were cured in room environment (18-23 degrees C and 70 +/- 10% relative humidity) until tested. The results show that, density of hardened GPC mixtures is similar to that of normal-weight OPC concrete. Inclusion of additives enhanced the mechanical strengths significantly as compared to control concrete. For similar compressive strength, flexural strength of ambient cured GPC was higher than that of OPC concrete. Modulus of elasticity of ambient cured GPC tend to be lower than that of OPC concrete of similar grade. Prediction of elastic modulus by Standards and empirical equations for OPC concrete were found not conservative for GPC. Thus, an equation for conservative prediction of elastic modulus of GPC is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2020,130,10,ED9BK,2019/5/25

ISFC was used as a partial replacement of cement from 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% to 40% by weight of Portland cement (OPC). The powder materials were design to have three total powder contents of 450, 550 and 650 kg/m(3), whereas the water-powder (OPC plus ISFC) material ratio for all mixtures was kept constant at 0.40.

Results of performing dynamic creep test revealed that, with respect to both modification types, Rheofalt modified mixtures resulted in significantly greater rutting resistance than ECB modified ones. Moreover, it was found that although ECB modified bitumen is effective to rutting enhancement, there is no improvement as a result of direct addition of it into mixtures. On the other hand, results showed that Rhefalt is influential in direct addition into mixtures but not as efficient as introduction of Rheofalt modified bitumen into mixes.

In this study, well cement samples were designed to be exposed to humid CO2 gas and CO2 saturated brine and simultaneously subjected to external tensile stresses with load levels of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the initial tensile strength. The experimental results showed that a higher external tensile stress (50% and 75%) facilitated the generation and propagation of micro-cracks in the tension zone of loaded samples. Hence, the aggressive CO2-rich medium found direct paths to penetrate further into the core, significantly accelerating the rate of carbonation and failure of the well cement. As a result of the faster ion exchange and transfer, the carbonation rate was faster and the onset of failure in samples immersed in CO2-saturated brine occurred earlier than in the supercritical CO2 scenario.

Some one-part geopolymers gain satisfying compressive strengths and are quite water-resistant similar to the two-part ones. It is found that alkali alters and deepens the thermal decomposition of the bentonite and transforms quartz impurity into X-ray amorphous cementing-active glassy phases. Nepheline is usually generated in the alkali fused bentonite, and gehlenite also occurs when calcined at 1000 degrees C. Different kinds of zeolites appear in the one-part geopolymers, while the calcium ferrites, only found in the precursors exclusively activated by Na2CO3, lead to produce additional hydrous gehlenite, so Na2CO3 seems facilitates hydration more effective than NaOH given the pastes from the precursors calcined with Na2CO3 possess higher compressive strengths. Moreover, the ferric oxide and calcium oxide have potential to enhance the cementing properties according to the mechanisms with calcination and hydration. The low hydrolysis rate might lead to poor water-resistance and the softening coefficient of the pastes increases with alkali content and calcination temperature for one-part geopolymers.

Although the inclusion of POFA did not reduce the strength loss upon exposure to elevated temperature, the addition of fibres above 0.3% had slight effect in reducing the compressive strength loss. Thus, based on the optimization in terms of the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths, it is recommended to incorporate high volume POFA and addition of polymer fibres exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction for non-structural application in building materials.

However, because of the elastoplastic properties of steel bars, the post yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column can be very slight or even negative. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) can provide a high degree of ultimate strength, light weight, and protection from corrosion. By combining steel and FRP, a designable post-yield stiffness can be achieved for concrete structures reinforced with steel-FRP composite bars (SFCBs) or hybrid steel/FRP bars. This paper conducted cyclic loading tests on four concrete columns with different reinforcement types, including steel bars, hybrid steel/FRP bars, and SFCBs. The test results showed that (1) the columns reinforced with different bars had similar strain distributions from column base to cap prior to yielding. After yielding, the plastic deformation of the ordinary RC column concentrated at the column base and the loading capacity decreased with the increase of lateral drift because of the P-delta effect. (2) Unlike the negative post-yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column, the post-yield stiffness of a column with hybrid reinforcements was positive. As the post-yield stiffness ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement increased by 27 percent, the post-yield stiffness of the concrete column increased by 7.4 percent. Therefore, the corresponding displacement ductility could reach 11 much greater than that of the RC column (6.28). (3) As a result of the more robust hysteretic curve of the RC column, the equivalent viscous damping coefficients of the RC column were greater than those of the hybrid column, whereas the hybrid reinforced concrete columns could dissipate earthquake energy without a corresponding loss of strength.

However due to the sensitivity of glass to thermal shock and the considerably temperature-dependent behaviour of interlayer materials as a result of their visco-elastic nature, the mechanical behaviour of laminated glass will be severely influenced by exposure to fire. Relatively little research has been conducted in the past to study the response of load bearing structural glass, and laminated glass in particular to radiant heating. This paper represents an effort to try to understand the effects of through depth radiation absorption and temperature conduction through laminated glass with a view to ultimately developing a model for studying load bearing glass exposed to elevated temperatures, such as those that would be expected in a fire. The paper reports on an experimental research programme in which several monolithic and laminated glass configurations were exposed to a radiant heat flux to study the different phenomena that occur upon exposure to fire conditions, including the ratios of absorbed, transmitted and reflected heat flux to the incident heat flux. The paper then presents a numerical heat transfer model which is developed based on these experimental results and that is able to determine the evolution of the temperature profile as a result of a given incident heat flux. The effectiveness of the heat transfer model is demonstrated through comparison with the temperatures measured during the experimental work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The main parameters considered in the study are the replacement ratio of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) and the content of the basalt fibre. The research work is focused on the influences of the above parameters on the failure mode, compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and the ultimate strain of the BF reinforced RAC. The results show that the mechanical properties of RAC can be enhanced by using BF. The SEM observations of the concrete reveal that the BF accumulated in pores and on the surface of the attached mortar can not only strengthen the RAC, but also improve the microstructure of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), which further enhances the strength and ductility of the RAC. Therefore, the basalt fibre reinforced RAC can be used in construction to reduce the environmental hazards from a large amount of earthquake waste from collapsed buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is urgent to seek appropriate ways to resolve oily wastewater and organic solvent pollution. A versatile oil-absorbing material which can separate the oily wastewater effectively and quickly is in high demanded for this issue. In this work, we report a facile and inexpensive to fabricate an effective and recyclable oil-absorbent, namely MnO2 nanowires/polyurethane (PU) foam composites, using a PU sponge as a porous substrate and MnO2 nanowires as modifiers. The hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize MnO2 nanowires and then foaming technology is used to fabricate MnO2 nanowires/PU foam composites. In order to enhance the hydrophobic and oleophilic properties, the surfaces of MnO2 nanowires are chemically modified using silane coupling agent (KH 570). The present MnO2 nanowires/PU foam composites not only effectively separate oils from water as expected, but also possess a very high absorption capacity for the removal of organic-solvents from water up to 40.15 times its own weight. More importantly, the obtained MnO2 nanowires/PU foam composites is demonstrated to have excellent oil recoverability and absorbent regenerability, making them versatile and comprehensive absorbents to satisfy various practical oily wastewater and organic solvent separation requirements.

Removal of benzene at 1.0 mM was seen within 160 min, depending on the molar ratios of SPC to Fe(III). A mechanism of benzene degradation was elaborated by free-radical probe-compound tests, free-radical scavengers tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, and determination of Fe(II) and H2O2 concentrations. The degradation products were also identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) was the leading species in charge of benzene degradation. The formation of HO center dot was strongly dependent on the generation of the organic compound radical (R-center dot) and superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)). Benzene degradation products included hydroxylated derivatives of benzene (phenol, hydroquinone, benzoquinone, and catechol) and aliphatic acids (oxalic and fumaric acids). The proposed degradation pathways are consistent with radical formation and identified products. The investigation of selected matrix constituents showed that the Cl and HCO3- had inhibitory effects on benzene degradation. Natural organic matter (NOM) had accelerating influence in degrading benzene. The developed system was tested with groundwater samples and it was found that the Fe(III)-activated SPC has a great potential in effective remediation of benzene contaminated groundwater while more further studies should be done for its practical application in the future because of the complex subsurface environment.

The filter was composed of a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) matrix infused with lithium ion sieves (LIS) H1.6Mn1.6O4. Characterization of the LIS/PAN NF confirmed its favorable structural and surface properties for effective Li+ adsorption. The LIS/PAN NF was mechanically suitable as a microfiltration membrane with high water flux and low pressure requirement. Breakthrough experiments at varied feed concentrations (C-f), seawater fiowrates (F), and NF thicknesses (Z) revealed the dynamic adsorption behavior of the filter. The seawater residence time was most critical and must be kept >= 0.12 min at any given C-f and Z to maximize the Li+ capacity of the filter. This can be conveniently achieved by adjusting the F of the process. Analogous to a packed bed system, the predictive power of nine breakthrough models were determined through non-linear regression analyses. Results reveal that bed-depth-space-time, Bohart-Adams (BA) and Thomas models adequately predicted the performance of the filter albeit BA exhibited the best agreement.

The nanoflowers were employed as support for Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) covalent immobilization. The maximum amount of CALB immobilized on the nanoflowers was 93 mg/g(support), while the specific hydrolytic activity was 22,700 U/g(support).

In addition, the CALB@nanoflowers could catalyze the synthesis of alkyl levulinates through the esterification of levulinic acid alcohols with different chain length (n-butyl alcohol, n-caprylic alcohol, n-lauryl alcohol) in a solvent-free system effectively. After recycling 10 times, the CALB@nanoflowers retained more than 85% of its initial activity in catalyzing the synthesis of butyl-levulinates and more than 96% of the initial activity in catalyzing the synthesis of long chain alkyl levulinates, which was much higher than commercial N435.

A self-polymerized polydopamine coating process was initially conducted to obtain the highly adjustable active surfaces. The TMICMs were then prepared through an in situ photoinitiated ATRP method by using N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) as the thermo-responsive backbone monomer. Attributing to the formation of the polydopamine coating surfaces, remarkably enhanced rebinding capacity (2.343 mmol cm(-2)) was obtained. Importantly, the as-prepared TMICMs with thermo-responsive ""specific recognition sites"" also exhibited excellent temperature-dependent switching modes for selective recognition and separation of the template molecule (ciprofloxacin).

Filamentous bacteria initiated a granulation process under the action of internal circulation, and maintained the stability of GS for a long period by wrapping biomass aggregates together.

A significant CO2 capacity improvement of up to 36% was achieved. It was found that higher CO2 uptakes were related to removal of inorganic impurities i.e. mineral matter and increase of the submicropores volume i.e. smaller than 0.8 nm. Sorbents were thoroughly characterized in terms of texture and chemical composition. CO2 uptake was determined by BET isotherm measurement carried out at 273 K and pressure of up to 0.95 bar. The enhancement of CO2 uptake was observed especially for ACs with the highest initial mineral matter content. It was found that mineral matter in ACs plays the role of a ballast and additionally blocks adsorption places and submicropores volume thus lowers CO2 uptake. On the other hand it was proven that mineral matter may prevent the structure from collapsing and thus can stabilize high SSA. The AC surface oxidation effect on CO2 uptake was determined by comparison of ACs treated with HCI and HNO3. Both acids remove mineral matter content to the same degree, but detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study revealed that in case of HNO3 treatment, AC surface was more oxidized which correlated with higher CO2 uptake.

Three feeds with different compositions were created, rich (lambda = 0.98), stoic (lambda = 1), and lean (lambda = 1.02) and five photocatalysts were tested: TiO2 isopropoxide, TiO2 P25 and TiO2-P25 with addition of 1% of Pt, Fe or Ce. Pt-TiO2 P25 showed the highest activity for NO and hydrocarbons (C3H6, C3H8) removal, with hydrocarbons oxidation being promoted in lean conditions of feed and NO reduction in rich condition of feed, behavior similar to commercial three-way catalysts. Additional work was carried out in order to study separately the main reactions that take place on the catalytic surface. For NO decomposition/oxidation reaction in the presence of water there was no NO2 formation observed and also no deactivation of the catalyst which indicates that decomposition reaction is the main reaction with good selectivity to N-2 formation for these conditions. In C3H6 oxidation the increase of O-2 inlet concentration leads to the increase of the reaction rate and in redox reaction of NO with C3H6 the results showed that a secondary reaction for C3H6 is required to explain the conversion values. The kinetic study of the reactions showed that Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression can interpret the experimental data assuming that NO and C3H6 are co-adsorbed on the same active sites, with dissociatively adsorption of C3H6 and O-2 adsorption on different active sites.

Without the improved reaction activity in the presence of supercritical solvents, water and ethanol in this study, at the subcritical conditions, Hp-supported Ru catalyst achieved 16.5% yield of small molecule phenolic hydrocarbons, including guaiacol, 4-methylguaiacol, 4-ethylguaiacol, cerulignol, and iso-eugenol, and produced degraded lignin polymer with 63% decreased weight-average molecular weight based on polystyrene-calibrated gel permeation chromatography results. The catalytic depolymerization activity was determined by the quantity of acid sites on the catalysts; however, the presence of metal nanoparticles is required to supply hydrogen atoms to the reaction system, which particles improve the catalytic depolymerization activity.

Heterogeneous catalysis has been explored for the removal of inorganic pollutants from water with promising results. In this work we aim to improve the efficiency of the catalytic reduction of bromate to bromine by exploring different supports (activated carbon, titanium dioxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes) for the catalytic metallic phase (Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru). Improvements of the turn-over frequency in the order of 1000 from previously reported activated carbon supported catalysts were obtained with titanium dioxide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes for experiments using 10 mg L-1 initial concentration of bromate; leading to complete conversion into bromide in under 5 min for TiO2 and 30 min for MWCNT. On the other hand, the use of structured catalysts for advanced water treatment processes has been recently shown as a promising alternative for conventional catalysts. We demonstrate the application of highly active metal-support pairings on a structured catalyst towards bromate removal during continuous operation, achieving up to 87% bromate conversion at steady-state.

The visible-light photocatalytic activity was maximized at the dose of 5 mg/L CS-Ag3PO4, which obviously maintained the high activity even after five cycles. The remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity could be mainly attributed to the slow recombination between photo-induced carriers and the strong visible-light absorption ability.

The properties of the membranes were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermal gravimetry (DTG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and tensile test. Moreover, swelling of prepared membranes at 25 degrees C was found for a quaternary feed solution. Results showed that the acid conversion rate was improved with the increasing TCN content of the membranes.

Both the MBR and MBMBR were found less prone to membrane fouling under the longer SRTs. The MBMBR showed consistently superior membrane filtration performance, and the extension of membrane filtration time was more pronounced at the shortest SRT. From the characterization of the mixed liquor suspensions, it was found that the mitigation of membrane fouling in the MBMBR was probably attributed to the lower concentrations of biopolymers (including proteins and carbohydrates) and low molecular weight (LMW) compounds in the mixed liquor supernatant (MLS). The findings were further justified by the analysis of organic fractions in the fouling cake layer, where the biopolymers were found to play a significant role in the cake layer formation. Through DNA pyrosequencing analysis which can reveal microbial community structures, the abundance of Nitrospira spp. (one of key bacterial populations responsible for nitrification) was found to be largely affected by the SRT. More Nitrospira spp. could develop in the attached biofilm than in the suspended biomass under the shorter SRTs of 10 and 5 d. Furthermore, predominance of an uncultured bacterial genus within family Saprospiraceae was found in the MBMBR at all the examined SRTs, which can be an important explanation for its lower concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins in MLS of the MBMBR.

Single-shell NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres are obtained with deionized water as solvent. Furthermore, ethylene glycol can decrease the aquo groups (H2O) number within the coordination sphere of Ni2+/Co2+, which leads to a decrease of hydrated metal ions size and more penetrated metal ions into RF microspheres that is essential to the formation of more shells. Thus, double and triple-shell NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres are harvested when ethylene glycol is solvent and the heating ramp rate are 2 and 5 degrees C/min, respectively. Larger heating ramp rate (2-5 degrees C/min) increases the temperature gradient of the infused RF microspheres, which favors the separation between adjacent NiCo2O4 layers and RF cores, and thus resulting in the formation of more shells. What's more, shells become thick and more compact when the precursor concentration is increased from 0.05 to 0.1 M due to more infused Ni2+/Co2+. The electrochemical performance for super capacitors of NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres with thin multi-shells is superior to those with thick single shell. The better performances are attributed to multi-shells with more electroactive sites and hollow structures as ""ion-buffering reservoir"", while thin shell is beneficial to the diffusion of electrolyte/ions.

The influence of process parameters such as feed temperature, feed concentration on OSCs removal from model n-octane/sulfur compound mixtures was also examined. During the test, the commercial hydrophobic PEBA-based and PDMS-based composite membranes were applied. Conducted experiments with chosen sulfur species confirmed that the structure of a component and the resulting differences in the affinity toward tested membrane and physico-chemical properties can influence the membrane performance and led to different separation efficiency. Total flukes for n-octane/thiophene, n-octane/2-methylthiophene and octane/2,5-dimethylhiophene mixtures at 30 degrees C were equal to be 1.33, 1.42 and 1.29 kg/m(2) h in case of PEBA membrane and 7.21, 7.48 and 7.34 kg/m(2) h for PDMS-base membrane, with the corresponding separation factor beta values of 7.04, 3.95 and 1.25 for PEBA and 2.95, 1.56 and 1.01 for PDMS, respectively.

In this work, the large ionic radius lanthanum (La) was doped onto the layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which was conducive to remove the negatively charged GO. The results showed that the coagulation of GO on La-doped LDHs was dependent on pH and the types of electrolytes. After calcined at 400 degrees C for 4 h, the maximum GO removal capacities could reach 565.8 mg/g on Mg/Al/La-CLDHs and 558.6 mg/g on Ca/Al/La-CLDHs at GO initial concentration of 120 mg/L and LDHs content of 0.2 g/L. The short equilibrium time and high removal capacity suggested the huge advantage of LDHs in practical applications. More importantly, the La-doped LDHs could still exhibit high removal capacities after five cycles, indicating that the La doped LDHs hold good reusability and could be used for GO pollution cleanup from water.

The oxidation of sulfide by chemolithotrophic sulfide oxidation bacteria can produce elemental sulfur, an important chemical material. A membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) has been successfully implemented and demonstrated for enhanced sulfide oxidation and sulfur production, owning to its counter-diffusion design of oxygen supply. In this work, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the sulfide oxidation and sulfur production in the MABR in the presence of residual organics in the influent. The model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data from the long-term operation of the sulfide-oxidation MABR at different operational stages. The results suggested that the developed model could satisfactorily describe sulfide oxidation, sulfur production, sulfate accumulation and organics conversion in the MABR. The modelling results indicated that with the optimal combinations of sulfide loading and oxygen pressure, over 90% of sulfide removal and over 75% of sulfur recovery could be achieved. The sulfide oxidation and sulfur production would also be affected by the biofilm area to reactor volume (A/V) ratio in the MABR, with high A/V ratio might deteriorate the sulfur production efficiency depending on the oxygen pressure applied. Further, the increase of volatile fatty acids in the wastewater would not affect the sulfide oxidation efficiency but could enhance the sulfur production efficiency by decreasing the amount of sulfur oxidized to sulfate.

It takes the form of a channel composed of active faces on which surface plasma is generated in AC sinusoidal mode with a resonant power-supply. The chemical application targeted is the flexible and low energy-cost abatement of VOC present in air at low concentration, which is a major current industrial concern for safety and environmental reasons. Regarding the mechanical action, the SDBD acts as a pump. It is able to induce flow rates reaching up to 153 L/min for a 60 W consumption with an electro-mechanical yield of 0.0133% in open configuration, while as any pump, it falls down in connected configuration; 39 L/min connected to our air treatment bench. Regarding the chemical action, five VOC are tested, two ketones: acetone and butanone, two esters: methyl-butyrate and methyl-valerate, one aldehyde: butyraldehyde. They are injected at low concentration in a continuous air flow according to two modes of injection: (i) separately at 25 ppmv, or (ii) together at 10 ppmv each one, i.e. 50 ppmv total. The air flow rate is modulated via an additional pump for investigating an extended range: 8.5-179 L/min. Thus, for a fixed 60 W consumption, the specific input energy (SIE) goes from 20 J/L to 423 J/L. As expected, the results show that as the SIE is increased, better conversion rates are achieved. Based on the experimental results, a chemical model of the SDBD reactor is proposed for providing a physical interpretation while giving information for helping the design of an optimized double-action reactor.

At first, the effect of various parameters, such as: the reaction time, temperature, the volume ratio of [TBHEP][Br]ifuel, the initial concentration of sulfur in the liquid fuel and the types of the sulfur compounds on the extraction efficiency were investigated.

To develop a competitive and commercially viable technology, better mercury capture and regeneration performances of regenerable sorbents are required. For this purpose, non-thermal plasma was used to treat the magnetic sorbents FeMnOx synthesized by co-precipitation. The mercury adsorption tests showed that the treated sorbents with non-thermal plasma had higher mercury removal efficiency than raw sorbents, and longer treatment time resulted in higher efficiency. The main reason was that the content of the high valence manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were greatly increased by non thermal plasma treatment, and this played a significant role in the mercury removal process. Further analysis showed that the lattice oxygen coming from the stepwise reduction of manganese oxide (MnO2 -> Mn2O3 -> MnO) served as an oxidant in the reaction with Hg degrees. The NO, SO2 and H2O inhibited the mercury adsorption while O-2 and HCl promoted mercury removal. High valence of manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were consumed during mercury adsorption, while non-thermal plasma treatment could replenish it and increase mercury removal regeneration performance better than without non thermal plasma treatment. In summary, the combination of magnetic separation, thermal regeneration and plasma treatment makes FeMnOx an excellent recyclable sorbent for mercury emission control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thermodynamic analysis showed that the co-precipitation/adsorption process was spontaneous, exothermic and physical in nature, involving weak interactions, such as electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and adhesive force between the emulsified oil droplets and the binding sites on the surface of IGMHs. It was observed that IGMHs lost approximately 18.9% adsorption capacity for emulsified oil after more than four cycles. Therefore, IGMHs could be used effectively for at least four cycles.

Pressure drop was found to be linearly proportional to retraction, and new correlations were introduced. Higher inner gas flows typically widened sprays for the base geometry only and lowered the droplet length scales, indicating that the lower droplet size limit was not set by viscosity limitations. Modulation of the inner gas at its dominant tone did not strongly affect many metrics, except that the inner gas pulsations substantially increased. Slurry video analyses provided spray angle directional trends so that a subset of the domain could be simulated to save computational time. Relative to prior air-water (AW) studies, SH flow patterns and acoustics typically differed significantly, with the exception of the base geometry spray profiles at the higher inner gas flows, along with the droplet length scale. In general, SH simulations showed lower pressure drop, astoundingly lower pressure temporal variability, higher dominant tones, and less periodicity (more diffused spectra). Furthermore, the relationship between 3D SH droplet size and distance was of the form constant/distance; the constant was the same for both feed materials.

Additionally, the adsorption behavior of the membrane was eval uated using different kinetic and isotherm models. The results showed that the adsorption kinetic behavior was in a good agreement with the pseudo-first-order and Elovich model in the low and high nickel concentrations, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption of nickel ions was fit well on Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The reusability of the reinforced polyHIPE membrane was evaluated for five sorption-desorption cycles.

WOS:000389166400059,"Bezza, FA; Chirwa, EMN",The role of lipopeptide biosurfactant on microbial remediation of aged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-contaminated soil,English,Article,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been recognised as priority pollutants due to their carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic properties. Bioremediation of PAHs is limited by low bioavailability of soil-bound PAHs due to their low aqueous solubility, high hydrophobicity and strong sorption to soil. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biodegradation enhancement potential of a heavy molecular mass lipopeptidal biosurfactant produced by Bacillus cereus SPL-4 on an aged wood treatment plant soil heavily contaminated with PAHs. In the laboratory scale batch treatments conducted (concentration of 6745.5 mg kg(-1), sum of 13 PAHs) the high molecular weight PAHs removal rate was significantly enhanced in the biosurfactant supplemented microcosms than in the surfactant free controls. In the microcosms supplemented with 0.2 and 0.6% (w/w) lipopeptide, 51.2% of 4-ring and 55% of 5- and 6 ring PAHs; 64.1% of 4-ring and 79% of 5- and 6-ring PAHs were removed respectively, compared to 29% of 4-ring and 25.5% of 5- and 6-ring PAHs removal in the surfactant free control after 64 days of incubation. However, there was no statistically significant change in the degradation rates of low molecular weight PAHs in surfactant amended and surfactant free controls. Fitting the experimental data to two compartment model showed that the biosurfactant addition at 0.2 and 0.6% (w/w) increased the fast degradation fraction to 34.2 and 63% respectively, compared to 6% at the surfactant free controls. The degradation of 5 and 6 ring PAHs was significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) in the higher surfactant dosage compared to the lower dosage. The results suggest that biosurfactant assisted degradation by microbial consortium may be a promising practical bioremediation strategy for aged PAH-contaminated soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, effective removal and understanding the mechanism of organoarsenic compounds are of significant urgency. We herein investigated the interactions of organoarsenic compounds with ferric and manganese binary oxide (FMBO) to investigate their adsorption efficiency and mechanism, whereas ferric oxide (FeOOH), and manganese oxide (MnO2) were also studied for the comparison. The maximum adsorption capacities (Q(max)) of FMBO towards p-ASA and ROX were determined to be 0.52 and 0.25 mnol g(-1) (pH = 7.5). FeOOH and MnO2 showed lower adsorption capability, the corresponsive Q(max), (p-ASA) were 0.40 and 0.33 mmol g(-1) and Q(max), (ROX) were 0.08 and 0.07 mmol g(-1), respectively. The elevated pH inhibited the adsorption onto the adsorbents owing to the increased repulsive forces; the Q(max), (p-ASA) and Q(max,) (ROX) onto FMBO increased to 0.79 and 0.51 mmol g(-1) at pH 4.0. Based on results of UV-vis spectra, UPLC-ICP-MS, FTIR, and XPS, the synergistic effect of heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption was the core for efficient aqueous removal of p-ASA by FMBO. Manganese oxide showed significant oxidation of p-ASA, while adsorption process was observed in ferric oxide and this effect also involves in the adsorption of ROX. Results herein extended the knowledgebase on organoarsenic species adsorption to Fe/Mn oxides, are important for potential engineering treatment application and help us to understand reactions at the interfacial level.

The removal performance of the TPPB-BTF was simultaneously compared with a conventional BTF, which served as a control. Industrial-grade silicone oil was used as the non-aqueous phase in the TPPB-BTF due to its high affinity for styrene. Both bioreactors were operated at styrene inlet concentrations ranging from 55 to 323 mg C m(-3) and empty bed residence times (EBRT) of 15-30 s, corresponding to pollutant loading rates of 13-77 g C m(-3) h(-1). Both bioreactors exhibited styrene removal efficiencies (REs) higher than 90% at an EBRT of 30 s. Nevertheless, the TPPB-BTF showed a superior removal performance than that recorded in the control BTF at EBRTs shorter than 30 s. REs of 89%, 84% and 57% were recorded in the TPPB-BTF at EBRT of 15 s and loading rates of 13, 22 and 77 g C m(-3) h(-1), respectively, while the control BTF supported removal efficiencies of 64%, 42% and 18-42% under the same experimental conditions. The resilience and robustness of the TPPB-BTF over styrene shock loadings and transient inlet concentration was also confirmed, the TPPB-BTF being able to recover a stable RE of 89% one day after such operation disturbances. The potential of the TPPB-BTF towards full scale applications was also critically discussed based on the experimental determination of silicone oil loses through aqueous phase renewal, which accounted for 0.4% of the initial volume of oil added to the TPPB-BTF after 87 days of operation.

Herein, solar photocatalytic technology is used for the degradation of model pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen (ACE) and antipyrine (ANT), with novel TiO2-ZnO/clay nanoarchitectures. These photocatalysts are based on the heterojunction between TiO2-ZnO semiconductors and a delaminated layered clay. The structural, electronic and textural features of the photocatalysts were characterized by different techniques. The degradation rate has been checked under different conditions, including target compound and catalyst concentrations, intensity of the solar light and the combination of pharmaceuticals. ANT showed a higher degradation rate than ACE and in both cases the degradation was favored at low concentrations. The disappearance of both compounds was well described by a simple pseudo-first-order rate equation. Although both target compounds were almost completely removed, some TOC was still remaining corresponding to short-chain carboxylic acids and unidentified by-products with very low significance in terms of ecotoxicity. Scavengers were used to learn on the radical mechanism of the reaction and different behavior was observed for each target compound. The results of this study prove the ability and stability after several operation cycles of these novel photocatalysts to promote the degradation of these pollutants under solar light irradiation.

The effects of the initiator (ceric ammonium nitrate, or CAN), crosslinker (N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide, or N,N'-MBA) and saponification agent (NaOH) under different reaction conditions (time, temperature, and shear intensity) were systematically studied. Also investigated was the effect of starch with different amylose content. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed that using this simple technique, SBSAPs were successfully prepared from either high-athylopectin starch (waxy corn starch) or high-amylose starch (Gelose 50) grafted with AM and crosslinked by N,N'-MBA. Gel strength was evaluated by rheometry, which revealed a significant increase in storage modulus (G') obtained in the crosslinked high-amylose SBSAP gels. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a more sophisticated structural network with a smaller pore size in the crosslinked high-amylose gels. Urea as a fertilizer was embedded in the SBSAP gel network, and this network controlled the urea release in water. The release rate of urea depended on the gel strength, gel microstructure and water absorption capacity (WAC) of SAP, which was affected by the reaction conditions and degree of saponification.

XRD, SEM, CH4-TPD, TGA, and BET techniques were used to characterize the prepared materials. The XRD results confirmed that all of the prepared materials possessed pure hexagonal phases in the case of Co1Ti1Ox and Ni1Ti1Ox and mixed formations composed of metal oxides and rutile TiO2 in the case of Fe1Ti1Ox and Cu1Ti1Ox. The CH4-TPD and H-2-TPR analyses showed that the highest adsorption is obtained on CuTiOx, in particular on Cu1.5Ti1 Ox. The oxygen carrier capacities of the samples were measured in H-2 (FR)/air (AR) and CH4-CO2 (FR)/air (AR) redox systems at 850 degrees C using TGA analysis. Their variability was shown to be associated with the different doping elements and doping concentrations. In particular, the Cu1.5Ti1Ox material in the CH4-CO2 (FR)/air (AR) redox system exhibits oxygen uncoupling behaviour, leading to improved capture and release of oxygen compared to the other materials.

Nicker depositing on the lignin surface was carried out by two different procedures. According to the first procedure, Ni was deposited from an aqueous solution of nickel acetate by impregnation. The second procedure included depositing a colloid solution of nickel particles in toluene preliminary obtained by metal vapor synthesis (MVS). As a result in both cases Ni particles of 6 nm size were formed on the lignin surface. Both types of nanocatalysts govern the microwave (MW) assisted DR of lignin. MW treatment of the mechanical mixture of a carbon sorbent with a high dielectric loss factor, and a Ni-containing lignin sample obtained by the first method resulted in the 65 wt.% lignin conversion to synthesis gas with the H-2/CO ratio of similar to 1/1. The content of syngas in the products was 8090 wt.%. It was found that MW treatment sharply increases the yield of syngas in the reforming as compared with the convective heating. The Ni-containing lignin samples before and after reforming were investigated by XRD, TEM, EDA, and magnetic measurements. It was established that different depositing procedures lead to the formation of X-ray amorphous Ni particles with markedly different magnetic properties. In contrast to entirely paramagnetic sample obtained from nickel acetate solution, superparamagnetic Ni particles formed by MVS exhibited a high capacity for absorption of MWI, sufficient for plasma to be generated and the reforming temperature to be reached without an additional sorbent.

Chlorine disinfection process is thought as an efficient way to remove ANT, however, the potential risks of chlorine disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethane (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAS) cannot be ignored. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been adopted as an effective alternative disinfectant of chlorine to reduce THMs and HAAS formation. In this work, the reaction kinetics and degradation pathway of ANT with ClO2 were studied to investigate the feasibility of using ClO2 as oxidant to degrade ANT. Experimental results demonstrated that ANT oxidation by ClO2 followed second-order kinetics, and the second-order rate constant (k(app)) was determined to be 4.8 x 10(-1) M-1 s(-1) at neutral pH. Higher pH could accelerate the reaction when pH < 9, while strong alkaline environment (pH > 9) might significantly slow down the oxidation process. Structural change during the reaction was proposed with the assistance of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), C=C and C-N bond of ANT were vulnerable under electrophilic attack of ClO2. Degradation pathways of ANT with ClO2 were suggested based on the main intermediate products. ANT was firstly transformed into ANT-Cl through single-electron-transfer (SET) and substitution reaction. Further oxidation of this intermediate product involved ring-opening reaction and de-carbonyl reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,309,9,ED9BY,2019/8/19

A remarkable observation is that the thin microbelts structured PMT perovskite (PMTT) exhibited an excellent water splitting performance and it is more sensitive to the illuminated visible light.

Although biomass aerogels can remedy the mechanical brittleness in contrast to conventional silica aerogels, regrettably causing a major decrease in SSA aspect. Here we present a generalizable synthetic means towards a family of chitosan aerogels (CAs) with large internal surface area, originating from chitosan sols in ethanol/water binary medium. The as-prepared CAs show high SSA of 973 m(2) g(-1) , appropriate texture homogeneity and thermal stability, attributing to uniformly inter-associated structures. We found an emergent phenomenon that free-standing wet chitosan gel could be still produced despite greatly lowering its substance concentration, attesting the remarkable role of ethanol for promoting gelatum formation. This enhancement to gelation is due to the introduction of micro-dispersed active phases upon. ethanol/water excitation, easily forming fine interconnected skeletons of CAs. The adsorption tests of CAs for abatement of methyl orange (MO) verify that dye-treated water almost recovers into pure one, well in line with the evidence of high SSA CAs.

The EKRT represents a very promising approach, as it is able to produce results comparable to those of other on/off-site interventions, though with appreciably higher levels of acceptability.

Consequently, the selection of an appropriate DS is vital for the process efficiency, besides the required selectivity and permeance of the membrane and the efficient DS regeneration process. A wide variety of DS have been tested so far and this paper aims to review recent advances in the synthesis and selection of an appropriate DS. It provides valuable information on a new type of draw solutes based on hybrid organic-inorganic nanosystems which, at a certain extent, show synergistic properties that face some of the technology shortcomings. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are the most promising nanosystems intended for desalination because they can be readily recovered applying a magnetic field or by conventional membrane processes. This review also deals with the most important characteristics of DS based on nanoparticles (NPs) and how they affect the performance of the overall processes. Finally, this review also highlights future research directions, where nanosystems will mitigate inverse diffusion and concentration polarization phenomena widely reported as limiting factors in FO processes.

The synthesized hierarchical metal oxides (HMOs) catalysts have been characterized by various characterization techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N-2 adsorption -desorption pore size distribution analysis. Characterization results shows that HMOs have higher surface properties and tunable porosity (BET surface area: 233.3-186.4 m(2) g(-1), pore volume: 0.88-0.65 cm(3) g(-1) and pore size: 6.8-7.4 nm). The effects of different operating parameters such as dose of catalysts, H2O2 concentration, initial pyridine concentration, solution pH, and treatment temperature have been studied and optimized the CPO method for pyridine removal. More than 90-95% pyridine and 85-90% total organic carbon (TOC) were removed at the optimum condition. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of intermediates byproducts formation and their final products generation was determine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A plausible degradation pathway has been proposed on the basis of the results of analysis. Synthesized HMOs presented the stable performance throughout the reuse for five cycles with negligible metals leaching. Kinetics and thermodynamic study of the parameters have also been evaluated.

Four different solvents: the primary amine monoethanolamine (MEA), the sterically hindered primary amine 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol (AMP), the tertiary amine N-methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA) and the carbonate salt solution K2CO3 were compared in concentrations from 5 to 50 wt% in a temperature range of 298-328 K with and without enzyme. Necessary mass transfer parameters such as liquid side mass transfer coefficient and solvent and enzyme reaction rates were determined and benchmarked to a 30 wt% MEA solution. The study reveals that the addition of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) dramatically increases the liquid side mass transfer coefficient for MDEA, and K2CO3; AMP has a moderate increase whereas MEA was unchanged. The results confirm that just bicarbonate forming systems benefit from CA. The influence of temperature on the enzyme kinetics and mass transfer coefficients is different for different solvent types. A temperature increase resulted in lower liquid side mass transfer coefficient for MDEA and K2CO3 but in a higher coefficient for AMP. The overall first order enzyme reaction rate (s(-1)) was linearly dependent on enzyme concentration for MDEA and K2CO3 at 313 K. Temperature and concentration did increase the enzymatic rate constant slightly in the concentration range of 5-15 wt% K2CO3 and significantly between 15 and 20 wt%. The enzymatic reaction rate constant for MDEA decreased with temperature, the solvent concentration had a negligible on it. The enzymatic reaction rate for AMP rose with temperature and was higher for lower solvent concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,309,15,ED9BY,2019/9/1

Solar irradiation is an important source of renewable energy; thus, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of light-absorbing particles that can achieve light-to-heat conversion. In this study, novel solar evaporation systems were designed and developed, with magnetic nanoparticles as photo-absorbers. The magnetic nanoparticles were coated with carriers, such as graphene oxide and paper. These hydrophilic carriers could provide large surface areas, low thermal conduction, or microporous surfaces for steam generation. Magnetic nanomaterials can absorb over 95% of sunlight; thus, an evaporation efficiency of up to 75% at only 1 kW/m(2) irradiation, as well as a decreased volume of wastewater were achieved. Furthermore, a reasonable amount of clean water was collected. These nanomaterials could be separated from wastewater by magnetic force, which can significantly reduce material consumption. These novel strategies successfully overcame previous problems, such as the demand for a high amount of sunlight. This study also opens an opportunity for the construction of a solar evaporation system for wastewater treatment with photo-absorbers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The crystal structure, photoluminescence (PL) as well as thermal stability properties of BLSO:Eu2+ phosphor are investigated systematically. The BLSO:Eu2+ phosphor exhibits a broad excitation band extending from 250 to 450 nm, and gives an intense asymmetric green emission band centered at 507 nm. Two different Eu2+ emitting centers are identified by their PL spectra and PL decay lifetimes in BLSO:Eu2+ phosphor. The optimal Eu2+ content in BLSO:Eu2+ is confirmed to be 5 mol%, and the corresponding concentration quenching mechanism is determined to the electric dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, compared to the initial one at room temperature, the PL intensity of the investigated phosphor can maintain 52% as heated up to 423 K.

Herein, the synthesis of cross-linked organic-inorganic polyphosphazene nanoshells (PZM) with amino-rich groups was reported via a facile condensation polymerization of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA) on silica (SiO2) nanospheres as templates. Then cuprcius oxide nanopartides (Cu2O NPs) were synthesized by simultaneous chemical reduction method on the surface of polyphosphazene nanoshells. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2@PZM@Cu spheres were incorporated into the EP to prepare samples for investigation of their flame-retardant and toxicity suppression performance. Herein, cone results indicated that the incorporation of 2 wt% SiO2@PZM@Cu obviously improved the flame-retardant performance of EP, such as 37.9% reduction in peak heat release rate and 31.3% decrease in total heat release. On the other hand, the amount of toxic CO and other volatile gas products from the EP decomposition significantly suppressed after incorporating the SiO2@PZM@Cu, implying a reduced toxicity. In addition, a mechanism for the flame retardancy and toxicity elimination was proposed. It is reasonable to believe that the enhanced flame retardancy and toxic effluents elimination for nanocomposites are attributed to synergistic effect from respective components (Cu2O NPs and PZM) plus the SiO2 spheres.

It is proposed that the Fe(III)-glycerol micro-reaction units that selectively adsorb to (0 0 1) or other planes result in different morphologies. The adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution onto these alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles showed that the removal efficiency up to 98.5% and 88.8% in 25 mg/L Cr(VI) solution, and the adsorption capacity reaches to 34.4 mg/g and 26.0 mg/g without pH adjustment. The adsorption kinetic is well described by the pseudo-second-order model and the Cr(VI) adsorption on the adsorbent agrees well with the Langmuir model. Lower surface areas and more excellent adsorption property associates with the chemisorption of Cr(VI) onto alpha-Fe2O3 (0 01), which is achieved by coordination between Cr(VI) and doubly or triply coordinated hydroxyl groups on alpha-Fe2O3 surface.

Therefore, the production of Fe-based carriers by spray drying was optimized in order to obtain mechanically strong particles with a homogeneous microstructure and dimensions fit for industrial fluidized CL-processes. The influence of the concentration of the binder and dispersing agent, the amount of solids and the milling procedure used in spray-drying suspensions on the morphology and microstructure of the resulting particles is studied by Hg-porosimetry, tapped density and optical and electronic microscopy. Increasing the amount of solids and reducing the amount of organic binder decreased the size of the internal cavity in the spray dried particles which led to a higher tapped density and better mechanical properties. The heat treatment during post-processing of these oxygen carriers also has a major influence on the remaining porosity of the oxygen carriers and is used to further optimize their mechanical properties as measured by the crushing strength and the attrition resistance. In this way spray-dried Fe-based oxygen carriers on an alumina carrier material with a crushing strength of 3.2 N and an air jet index of 2.1% are obtained at a sintering temperature of 1225 degrees C. The sample with the best mechanical properties was tested in a small lab-scale fluidized bed reactor during four cycles and compared with a more porous sample. The improvement of the morphology and the reduction of the porosity of the particles did not show a significant influence on the chemical performance of the oxygen carrier. The crushing strength of the oxygen carrier decreased to 2 N during activation and during reaction a slight hercynite accumulation was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work the adsorption kinetics of three different aromatic sulfur heterocycles was studied for Ag-Al2O3. The influence of individual as well as competitive adsorption on the selectivity order was investigated by equilibrium and breakthrough experiments. In these experiments a jet-A1 fuel enriched with benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT), and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) was used. The adsorption of aromatic sulfur heterocycles on Ag-Al2O3 proceeds via three different adsorption mechanisms. Within these mechanisms the pi-interaction (pi-Ag) and the direct sulfur-silver interaction (S-Ag) are significantly stronger in comparison to the acid base interaction (S-H). The results showed that the pi-Ag and S-Ag interactions are the major adsorption mechanisms in the first stage, where film diffusion limits the adsorption rate. In the second stage, the S-H interaction plays only an important role for BT, where intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling step. The overall selectivity order was found to be BT > DBT > 4,6-DMDBT in the case of competitive adsorption for both equilibrium and breakthrough performance. The S-H contribution was related to incorporation of silver into blank gamma-alumina, which significantly increased the overall acidity of the adsorbent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The single-event kinetic modeling concept is used to optimize a recycle reactor for 1-pentene cracking on ZSM-5.

Since the latter only contains propene and ethene in this idealized reactor configuration, the 1-pentene feed can be selectively converted to these lower olefins.

Immunological defense mechanisms act in concert with physiological processes like growth and reproduction, energy intake and metabolism, as well as neuronal development. Not only are psychological and environmental stressors communicated to the immune system, but also, vice versa, the immune response and adaptation to a current pathogen challenge are communicated to the entire body, including the brain, to evoke adaptive responses (e.g., fever, sickness behavior) that ensure allocation of energy to fight the pathogen. This phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved. Hence it is both interesting and important to consider the evolutionary history of this bi-directional neuroendocrineimmune communication to reveal phylogenetically ancient or relatively recently acquired, mechanisms. Indeed, such considerations have already disclosed an extensive ""common vocabulary"" of information pathways as well as molecules and their receptors used by both the neuroendocrine and immune systems.

In insects, mediators of the stress response (e.g. stress hormones) divert molecular resources away from immune function and towards tissues necessary for fight-or-flight behaviours. For example, molecules such as lipid transport proteins are involved in both the stress and immune responses, leading to a reduction in disease resistance when these proteins are shifted towards being part of the stress response system. Stress responses also alter immune system strategies (i.e. reconfiguration) to compensate for resource losses that occur during fight-or flight events. In addition, stress responses optimize immune function for different physiological conditions. In insects, the stress response induces a pro-inflammatory state that probably enhances early immune responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2020,66,9,EE4EN,2019/11/1

Some of the difficulty in obtaining responses in mammals probably lies in the conflation in the central nervous system (CNS), of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which makes the vertebrate neuroimmune response quite complex and difficult to dissect. An alternative strategy for understanding the relation between neural immunity and neural repair is to study an animal devoid of adaptive immunity and whose CNS is well described and regeneration competent. The medicinal leech offers such opportunity. If the nerve cord of this annelid is crushed or partially cut, axons grow across the lesion and conduction of signals through the damaged region is restored within a few days, even when the nerve cord is removed from the animal and maintained in culture. When the mammalian spinal cord is injured, regeneration of normal connections is more or less successful and implies multiple events that still remain difficult to resolve. Interestingly, the regenerative process of the leech lesioned nerve cord is even more successful under septic than under sterile conditions suggesting that a controlled initiation of an infectious response may be a critical event for the regeneration of normal CNS functions in the leech. Here are reviewed and discussed data explaining how the leech nerve cord sensu stricto (i.e. excluding microglia and infiltrated blood cells) recognizes and responds to microbes and mechanical damages.

More specifically, (i) we review molecular and cellular interactions between hormones of the HPG axis, and, as far as known, the involved mechanisms on immune functions, (ii) we evaluate whether the HPG-immune crosstalk serves as proximate mechanism mediating reproductive-immune trade-offs, and (iii) we ask whether the nature of the HPG-immune interaction is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, despite the changes in immune functions, reproductive modes, and life histories. In all vertebrate classes studied so far, HPG hormones have immunomodulatory functions, and indications exist that they contribute to reproduction-immunity resource trade-offs, although the very limited information available for most non-mammalian vertebrates makes it difficult to judge how comparable or different the interactions are. There is good evidence that the HPG-immune crosstalk is part of the proximate mechanisms underlying the reproductive-immune trade-offs of vertebrates, but it is only one factor in a complex network of factors and processes. The fact that the HPG-immune interaction is flexible and can adapt to the functional and physiological requirements of specific life histories. Moreover, the assumption of a relatively fixed pattern of HPG influence on immune functions, with, for example, androgens always leading to immunosuppression and estrogens always being immunoprotective, is probably oversimplified, but the HPG-immune interaction can vary depending on the physiological and envoironmental context. Finally, the HPG-immune interaction is not only driven by resource trade-offs, but additional factors such as, for instance, the evolution of viviparity shape this neuroendocrine-immune relationship.

Interestingly, ER beta is also expressed in some head kidney lymphocytes but not in naive PBLs. Immune stimulation altered the cell type specific profile of expression of these receptors, which depends on both activation and maturation stage. This implies direct leukocyte responsiveness to estrogen stimulation and therefore in vitro effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in monocytesimacrophages were determined. Short-time incubation with E2 increased ROS production in PMA-stimulated cells. Results comply with mediation by GPR30, partially functioning via phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation.

It comprises cytokine-producing lymphoid cells from the immune system and endocrine cells secreting cortisol, catecholamines, and thyroid hormones. The intimate organization of the immune system and endocrine system in one single organ makes bidirectional signalling between these possible. In this review we explore putative interactions between the thyroid and immune system in the head kidney. We give a short overview of the thyroid system, and consider the evidence for the presence of thyroid follicles in the head lcidney as a normal, healthy trait in fishes. From mammalian studies we gather data on the effects of three important pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6) on the thyroid system. A general picture that emerges is that pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit the activity of the thyroid system at different targets. Extrapolating from these studies, we suggest that the interaction of the thyroid system by paracrine actions of cytokines in the head kidney is involved in fine-tuning the availability and redistribution of energy substrates during acclimation processes such as an immune response or stress response.

Recent analyses of the human nail organ indicate a capacity for local immune tolerance, suggesting roles for adaptive immunity in the capacity for mammalian appendage regeneration. New information and better understanding regarding the neuroendocrine-immune axis in the response to stressors, including amputation, suggest additional approaches useful for investigating effects of the immune system during repair and regeneration.

Amphibians are facing historically unprecedented environmental stress due to climate change that will involve unpredictable temperature and rainfall regimes and possible nutritional deficits due to extremes of temperature and drought. At the same time, amphibians in all parts of the world are experiencing unprecedented declines due to the emerging diseases, chytridiomycosis (caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) and ranavirus diseases due to viruses of the genus Ranavirus in the family Iridoviridae. Other pathogens and parasites also afflict amphibians, but here I will limit myself to a review of recent literature linking stress and these emerging diseases (chytridiomycosis and ranavirus disease) in order to better predict how environmental stressors and disease will affect global amphibian populations.

Initially described as an anti-obesity hormone, leptin has subsequently been shown to exert pleiotropic effects, being also able to influence haematopoiesis, thermogenesis, reproduction, angiogenesis, and more importantly immune homeostasis. As a cytokine, leptin can affect both innate and adaptive immunity, by inducing a pro-inflammatory response and thus playing a key role in the regulation of the pathogenesis of several autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances on the role of leptin as immune-modulator in mammals and we also provide an overview on its main functions in non-mammalian vertebrates.

Light/dark cycles are the cues that synchronize the rhythmic changes in physiological processes, including immunity. This review summarizes our investigations on the bidirectional relationships between the chicken pineal gland and the immune system. We demonstrated that, in the chicken, the main pineal hormone, melatonin, regulates innate immunity, maintains the rhythmicity of immune reactions and is involved in the seasonal changes in immunity. Using thioglycollate-induced peritonitis as a model, we showed that the activated immune system regulates the pineal gland by inhibition of melatonin production at the level of the key enzyme in its biosynthetic pathway, arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). Interleukin 6 and interleukin 18 seem to be the immune mediators influencing the pineal gland, directly inhibiting Aanat gene transcription and modulating expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per3, which in turn regulate Aanat.

These compounds are typically synthesized under hydro (solvo)thermal conditions at relatively low temperature using various organic amines. Comprehensive reviews have summarized the preparation and structures of these main group metal chalcogenidometalates. A particular research challenge in this field is using the chelating imines, such as 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), in the synthesis of inorganic-organic hybrid main group metal chalcogenidometalates because their transition metal complexes can add new optical or electronic properties to the host chalcogenide compounds. Thus, a series of unique chalcogenidometalates with M-hen and M-bpy complexes (M = metal ions) have been isolated recently. These compounds have unusual optical and photoelectronic properties compared with those of the amine series. The present review focuses on recent developments in the synthesis, structures, and properties of these chalcogenidometalates. A comprehensive outline is provided of the chalcogenidometalate compounds with discrete M-phen/bpy complex cations or covalently bonded M-phen/bpy moieties.

Consequently, significant efforts are currently underway to develop sufficiently reliable and sensitive and yet possibly simple methods for this purpose. In this context, molecular sensing is particularly important, presenting itself as a useful tool for alleviating global security concerns, tackling environmental issues, and contributing to biomedical analysis and other associated areas. Innovatively designed molecules and metallo-organic moieties having a specifically tailored receptor site, a clearly defined reporter group, and a signal processing unit are the basic components of a working molecular sensor. However, solution-based molecular sensors, although of great standing, suffer frequently from relatively long response time as well as from poor solubility and recyclability of the sensing material. In contrast, surface-confined sensors permit easier manoeuvrability in different media and are characterized by a shorter response time, better signal amplification, as well as by regeneration and recyclability of the sensor through chemical or physical post-treatments. Additionally, depending on the structural, redox, or optical behavior of the analyte and the sensing material, a suitable transduction technique or a combination of several such techniques may be employed for analyzing surface attributes and studying analyte-host interaction. In this regard, SiOx substrates and molecular assembles thereon offer distinct advantages over other common supports such as metals, polymers, membranes, etc. in terms of cost, durability, stability, and scope. In this context, this review deals with the most recent developments in design and fabrication of molecular sensors confined on SiOx substrates. Here we provide representative and relevant examples of molecular sensors on these substrates, arranged with respect to the entities under analysis, viz. ions, specific gases, biomolecules, explosives, and warfare agents, paying also some attention to the general aspects of such sensor design.

Preventing blood clots in the heart to reduce stroke and TE risk is a key goal of AF therapy. Traditional stroke risk assessment tools for patients with nonvalvular AF include the CHADS2 and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores, while long-term outcome data with the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are emerging. The goals of this review were to assess traditional therapies and existing treatment guidelines and to discuss key pharmacologic properties of the DOACS, noting how these may benefit at-risk patients with AF. This narrative review was developed on the basis of the authors' clinical knowledge, extensive reading of the literature, and broad pharmacy experience in the management of patients with AF. Limitations of oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) include slow onset of action, the need for regular monitoring of their anticoagulation effect, significant food and drug interactions, and unpredictable dose-response properties. Key clinical trial data led to the approvals of apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the United States to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. With predictable pharmacologic properties and limited drug and/or dietary interactions, the DOACs offer several benefits over traditional oral anticoagulation therapy with VKA. However, they have limitations, including the absence of immediate reversal agents and limited options for monitoring their anticoagulation effects in clinical practice. As experience with the use of DOACs grows, optimized treatment regimens and improved patient care are expected.",2021,23,15,EE4QX,2019/11/19

Recently, a new version of the Sonoclot has been released, and the redesign may result in performance changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of the new (S2) and the previous (S1) Sonoclot. Methods: The S1 was used in the routine management of 30 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Blood samples were taken at baseline (T1), after heparin administration (200 U/kg, 100 U/kg; T2 and T3), during cardiopulmonary bypass (T4), after protamine infusion (T5), and before intensive care unit transfer (T6). Kaolin-based activated clotting time and gbACTs were measured in duplicate by both the old and the new device and performance compared by Bland-Altman analysis and percentage error calculation. Results: A total of 300 kACT and 180 gbACTs were available. Bland-Altman analysis for kACT revealed that S2 consistently reported results in shorter time compared to S1 (overall = -14.7%). Comparing S2 and S1, the glass bead-activated tests showed mean percentage differences of -18.9% (gbACTs), +37.4% (CR), and -3.7% (PF). Conclusion: Since clotting is faster in the new S2 compared to S1, shorter clotting times have to be considered in clinical practice. The use of S2 kACT in heparin management will result in higher heparin and protamine dosing unless heparin kACT target values are adjusted to correct for the differences in results between S1 and S2.",2021,23,7,EE4QX,2019/11/20

Aim: To analyze the relation between TGA and VTE risk according to Padua score in medical hospitalized patients. Methods: Between May and October 2013, 105 patients were included in an unselected cohort group of patients admitted to an internal medicine department in a large, university hospital.

Serum ferritin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and TRACP 5b were measured. Echocardiography was performed with assessment of BMD using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The BMD was decreased in patients with SCD compared with SCT and controls (P = .005), with no significant difference between the latter 2 groups. Patients with SCD had higher incidence of bone complications than SCT group and controls (P = .03). The SCD group with abnormal DXA scan had higher ferritin and ALP than normal BMD.

Patients treated with hydroxyurea and those on chelation therapy had lower TRACP 5b levels than untreated patients. The TRACP 5b level was positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, while there was no relation with ferritin, ALP, or BMD. We suggest that bone complications frequently occur in SCD as reflected by low BMD and high ALP and TRACP 5b. Hemolysis and iron overload may be involved in the occurrence of these complications.

This retrospective 12-month cohort study was designed to evaluate the association between persistent thrombocytopenia and mortality among surgical critically ill patients to determine the risk factors for persistent thrombocytopenia. The study included adult patients consecutively admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at our institution. Patients with a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia were identified from a prospective critical care database. We defined patients with persistent thrombocytopenia as those with thrombocytopenia lasting more than 7 consecutive days. The primary outcome of this study was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcomes were lengths of SICU stay and hospital stay. Fifty-one patients experienced persistent thrombocytopenia and 71 experienced nonpersistent thrombocytopenia. Among patients with persistent thrombocytopenia, mortality was significantly higher, and SICU and hospital stays were longer than those with nonpersistent thrombocytopenia. Risk factor analysis failed to predict which patients with thrombocytopenia would develop into persistent thrombocytopenia.

Collagen VI is expressed in a number of different tissues, but adipose tissue is a particularly prominent source for this extracellular matrix constituent. Mice lacking collagen VI are metabolically healthier due to reduced fibrosis in adipose tissue. Endotrophin seems to be one of the key players of collagen VI-mediated signalling effects, including its pro-fibrotic nature and chemoattractant properties for macrophages, while also playing an important role in cancer progression and the chemoresistance of tumour cells. The glucose-lowering class of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) that mediate their action through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma also exerts important effects on endotrophin by reducing the transcription of parental collagen VI molecules. As with many other pharmacological interventions, there is a range of responses observed in a diabetic patient population. In this issue of Diabetologia, Karsdal and colleagues (DOI:) demonstrate that baseline endotrophin levels offer excellent predictive values to indicate individuals who will show an optimised response to TZDs with respect to the lowering of HbA(1c) and reduced risk of adverse side effects.

Furthermore, we argue that accepting ABCD as a diagnosis will be critical in order to accelerate pharmaceutical, academic and public activities leading to clinical trials that could reverse beta cell autoimmunity and halt progression to symptomatic insulin-requiring type 1 diabetes.

The appearance of clinical symptoms is preceded by an asymptomatic preclinical period, the duration of which is highly individual. The emergence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies into the peripheral circulation is the first detectable sign of beta cell autoimmunity. If type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in childhood the preclinical period lasts for an average of 2.5-3 years, but clinical symptoms may in some cases appear within a few months or be delayed for more than 20 years. In this issue of Diabetologia, Bonifacio and colleagues (doi:) suggest that asymptomatic beta cell autoimmunity should be considered as a pathological and diagnostic entity. Although such a strategy may have some positive consequences, it might also have serious drawbacks. To label an asymptomatic child that may have 10-20 years of a healthy life ahead of him/her as a patient will most likely affect both the life of the family and the child. Therefore, we think that one should not adapt the new diagnosis before the psychological consequences of such a strategy have been assessed.

Randomised controlled clinical trials of a GAD + alum vaccine in human participants have so far given conflicting results. In this study, we sought to see whether a clearer answer to the question of whether GAD65 has an effect on C-peptide could be reached by combining individual-level data from the randomised controlled trials using Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the probability of a positive biological effect (a reduction in C-peptide loss compared with placebo approximately 1 year after the GAD vaccine). We estimate that there is a 98% probability that 20 mu g GAD with alum administered twice yields a positive biological effect. The effect is probably a 15-20% reduction in the loss of C-peptide at approximately 1 year after treatment.

Endotrophin, the C-terminal fragment of the alpha 3 chain of procollagen type VI (also called Pro-C6), is involved in both adipose tissue matrix remodelling and metabolic control. We established a serum assay for endotrophin to assess if this novel adipokine could identify type 2 diabetic patients who respond optimally to PPAR gamma agonists, improving the risk-to-benefit ratio. The BALLET trial (NCT00515632) compared the glucose-lowering effects and safety of the partial PPAR gamma agonist balaglitazone with those of pioglitazone in individuals with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin therapy. The per protocol population (n = 297) was stratified into tertiles based on baseline endotrophin levels. Participants were followed-up after 26 weeks, after which correlational analysis was carried out between endotrophin levels and measures of glucose control. This is a secondary post hoc analysis. Endotrophin was significantly associated with therapeutic response to balaglitazone and pioglitazone. At week 26, only individuals in the upper two tertiles showed significant reductions in HbA(1c) and fasting serum glucose compared with baseline. The OR for a 1% and a 0.5% reduction in HbA(1c) for individuals in the upper two tertiles were 3.83 (95% CI 1.62, 9.04) p < 0.01, and 3.85 (95% CI 1.94, 7.61) p < 0.001, respectively.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) may affect pancreatic endocrine function and glucose homeostasis through alterations in gene regulation. Our aim was to investigate the role of HDAC7 in human and rat pancreatic islets and clonal INS-1 beta cells (INS-1 832/13). To explore the role of HDAC7 in pancreatic islets and clonal beta cells, we used RNA sequencing, mitochondrial functional analyses, microarray techniques, and HDAC inhibitors MC1568 and trichostatin A. Using RNA sequencing, we found increased HDAC7 expression in human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic donors. HDAC7 expression correlated negatively with insulin secretion in human islets. To mimic the situation in type 2 diabetic islets, we overexpressed Hdac7 in rat islets and clonal beta cells. In both, Hdac7 overexpression resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, it reduced insulin content, mitochondrial respiration and cellular ATP levels in clonal beta cells. Overexpression of Hdac7 also led to changes in the genome-wide gene expression pattern, including increased expression of Tcf7l2 and decreased expression of gene sets regulating DNA replication and repair as well as nucleotide metabolism. In accordance, Hdac7 overexpression reduced the number of beta cells owing to enhanced apoptosis. Finally, we found that inhibiting HDAC7 activity with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta cells that were overexpressing Hdac7. Taken together, these results indicate that increased HDAC7 levels caused beta cell dysfunction and may thereby contribute to defects seen in type 2 diabetic islets.

Islets (150) were co-transplanted, with or without human MAPCs (2.5 x 10(5)) as separate or composite pellets, under the kidney capsule of syngeneic alloxan-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Blood glucose levels were frequently monitored and IPGTTs were carried out. Grafts and serum were harvested at 2 and 5 weeks after transplantation to assess outcome. Human MAPCs produced high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the induction of neo-angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Islet-human MAPC co-transplantation as a composite pellet significantly improved the outcome of islet transplantation as measured by the initial glycaemic control, diabetes reversal rate, glucose tolerance and serum C-peptide concentration compared with the outcome following transplantation of islets alone. Histologically, a higher blood vessel area and density in addition to a higher vessel/islet ratio were detected in recipients of islet-human MAPC composites. The present data suggest that co-transplantation of mouse pancreatic islets with human MAPCs, which secrete high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, enhance islet graft revascularisation and subsequently improve islet graft function.",2021,60,9,EE5GQ,2019/12/18

Nine healthy volunteers were randomised to treatment order of three different treatments (crossover design). Treatments were: (1) saline control; (2) hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH; i.v. bolus of 0.1 U/kg insulin); and (3) hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemia (HE; i.v. bolus of 0.1 U/kg insulin and 20% glucose). Inclusion criteria were that volunteers were healthy, aged > 18 years, had a BMI between 19 and 26 kg/m(2), and provided both written and oral informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a known chronic disease (including diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, ischaemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias) and regular use of prescription medication. The data was collected at the medical research facilities at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. The primary outcome was palmitic acid flux. Participants were blinded to intervention order, but caregivers were not. Adrenaline (epinephrine) and glucagon concentrations were higher during HH than during both HE and control treatments. NEFA levels and lipid oxidation rates (determined by indirect calorimetry) returned to control levels after 105 min. Palmitate flux was increased to control levels during HH (p = NS) and was more than twofold higher than during HE (overall mean difference between HH vs HE, 114 [95% CI 64, 165 mu mol/min]; p < 0.001). In subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, we found elevated levels of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin-1 phosphorylation 30 min after insulin injection during HH compared with both control and HE. There were no changes in the levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) or G(0)/G(1) switch gene 2 (G0S2) proteins. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR were unaffected by hypoglycaemia. Expression of the G0S2 gene increased during HE and HH compared with control, without changes in ATGL (also known as PNPLA2) or CGI-58 (also known as ABHD5) mRNA levels. These findings suggest that NEFAs become a major fuel source during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and that lipolysis may be an important component of the counter-regulatory response. These effects appear to be mediated by rapid stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) and HSL, compatible with activation of the beta-adrenergic catecholamine signalling pathway.

Additionally, we have demonstrated that CB activity is increased in animal models of insulin resistance, and that carotid sinus nerve (CSN) resection prevents the development of insulin resistance and arterial hypertension induced by high-energy diets. Here, we tested whether the functional abolition of CB by CSN transection would reverse pre-established insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, obesity, autonomic dysfunction and hypertension in animal models of the metabolic syndrome. The effect of CSN resection on insulin signalling pathways and tissue-specific glucose uptake was evaluated in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. Experiments were performed in male Wistar rats submitted to two high-energy diets: a high-fat diet, representing a model of insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity, and a high-sucrose diet, representing a lean model of insulin resistance and hypertension. Half of each group was submitted to chronic bilateral resection of the CSN. Age-matched control rats were also used. CSN resection normalised systemic sympathetic nervous system activity and reversed weight gain induced by high-energy diets. It also normalised plasma glucose and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity lipid profile, arterial pressure and endothelial function by improving glucose uptake by the liver and perienteric adipose tissue.

We aimed to find out whether mitochondrial measures are downregulated in obesity also in isolated adipocytes. We studied young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant (n = 14, intrapair difference Delta BMI >= 3 kg/m(2)) and concordant (n = 5, Delta BMI < 3 kg/m(2)) for BMI, identified from ten birth cohorts of 22- to 36-year-old Finnish twins. Abdominal body fat distribution (MRI), liver fat content (magnetic resonance spectroscopy), insulin sensitivity (OGTT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum lipids and adipokines were measured. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were obtained to analyse the transcriptomics patterns of the isolated adipocytes as well as of the whole adipose tissue. Mitochondrial DNA transcript levels in adipocytes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blots of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels in adipocytes were performed in obese and lean unrelated individuals. The heavier (BMI 29.9 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2)) co-twins of the discordant twin pairs had more subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat and were more insulin resistant (p < 0.01 for all measures) than the lighter (24.1 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) co-twins. Altogether, 2538 genes in adipocytes and 2135 in adipose tissue were significantly differentially expressed (nominal p < 0.05) between the co-twins. Pathway analysis of these transcripts in both isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue revealed that the heavier co-twins displayed reduced expression of genes relating to mitochondrial pathways, a result that was replicated when analysing the pathways behind the most consistently downregulated genes in the heavier co-twins (in at least 12 out of 14 pairs). Consistently upregulated genes in adipocytes were related to inflammation. We confirmed that mitochondrial DNA transcript levels (12S RNA, 16S RNA, COX1, ND5, CYTB), expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein transcripts and a major mitochondrial regulator PGC-1 alpha (also known as PPARGC1A) were reduced in the heavier co-twins' adipocytes (p < 0.05). OXPHOS protein levels of complexes I and III in adipocytes were lower in obese than in lean individuals.

Although cognition is impaired during hypoglycaemia, restoration of euglycaemia after recurrent hypoglycaemia is associated with improved hippocampally mediated memory. Recurrent hypoglycaemia alters glucocorticoid secretion in response to hypoglycaemia; glucocorticoids are well established to regulate hippocampal processes, suggesting a possible mechanism for recurrent hypoglycaemia modulation of subsequent cognition. We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids within the dorsal hippocampus might mediate the impact of recurrent hypoglycaemia on hippocampal cognitive processes. We characterised changes in the dorsal hippocampus at several time points to identify specific mechanisms affected by recurrent hypoglycaemia, using a well-validated 3 day model of recurrent hypoglycaemia either alone or with intrahippocampal delivery of glucocorticoid (mifepristone) and mineralocorticoid (spironolactone) receptor antagonists prior to each hypoglycaemic episode. Recurrent hypoglycaemia enhanced learning and also increased hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptors, serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation, and plasma membrane levels of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Both hippocampus-dependent memory enhancement and the molecular changes were reversed by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment. These results indicate that increased glucocorticoid signalling during recurrent hypoglycaemia produces several changes in the dorsal hippocampus that are conducive to enhanced hippocampus-dependent contextual learning. These changes appear to be adaptive, and in addition to supporting cognition may reduce damage otherwise caused by repeated exposure to severe hypoglycaemia.",2021,60,10,EE5GQ,2019/12/23

Diabetes was induced by tetracycline-inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of the insulin receptor in rats, generating TetO rats. Systemic treatment consisted of an AT1 blocker (ARB) at the onset of diabetes, following which, 4-5 weeks later the retina was analysed in vivo and ex vivo. Retinal function was assessed by Ganzfeld electroretinography (ERG). Retinal vessels in TetO rats showed differences in vessel calibre, together with gliosis.

Most studies have reported significant increases in liver cancer rates and decreases in lung cancer over time. Although some studies have reported significant increases in anal cancer rates and declines in Hodgkin lymphoma rates, others have shown stable incidence. Declining mortality among HIV-infected individuals has resulted in the growth and aging of the HIV-infected population, causing an increase in the number of non-AIDS-defining cancers diagnosed each year in HIV-infected people.

Recent findings HIV+ persons are at increased risk of cancer. As this risk is higher for malignancies driven by viral and bacterial coinfections, classifying malignancies into infection-related and infection-unrelated has been an emerging trend. Cohorts have detected major reductions in the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma and non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) following cART initiation among immunosuppressed HIV+ persons. However, recent randomized data indicate that cART reduces risk of Kaposi sarcoma and NHL also during early HIV infection before overt immunosuppression occurs. Long-term effects of cART exposure on cancer risk are not well defined; according to basic and epidemiological research, there might be specific associations of each cART class with distinct patterns of cancer risk. Summary The relationship between cART exposure and cancer risk is complex and nuanced. It is an intriguing fact that, whether initiated during severe immunosuppression or not, cART reduces risk of Kaposi sarcoma and NHL. Further research should identify mediators of the benefit of immediate cART initiation in reducing cancer risk, understand the relationship between long-term cART exposure and cancer incidence and assess whether adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce cancer risk during treated HIV infection.",2021,12,8,EE8IL,2020/1/5

This article reviews recent data on incidence and prevention efforts for HPV-related cancers in the ART era. Recent findings ART may confer some benefit with respect to reducing the risk of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cancer, but the degree of that benefit appears to be limited. The prevalence of anal HPV infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and anal cancer remain high among individuals on effective ART. The incidence of cervical cancer is high among HIV-infected women, particularly in countries wherein there are no organized cervical cancer prevention programmes. Efforts are in progress to define optimal screen-and-treat cervical cancer prevention programmes in different clinical settings and to define the efficacy of secondary prevention programmes for prevention of anal cancer.

This review will discuss the latest scientific evidence regarding the mechanisms driving lung cancer risk in HIV infection, the clinical presentation of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons and recent data regarding the outcomes, treatment and prevention of lung cancer in this group. Recent findings Increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons is primarily due to higher smoking rates, but emerging evidence also implicates immunosuppression and inflammatory processes. Lung cancer outcomes may be worse in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral era, but this may stem, in part, from treatment disparities. Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed tomography (CT) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general population, and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in HIV infected smokers. Summary Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV infection. It is associated with unique HIV-related causal mechanisms, and may be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV-infected persons.

A more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay existing between genetic abnormalities of tumor cells and the viral contribution to the development of EBV-associated lymphomas is pivotal for the development of more effective treatments. Recent findings Recent evidence indicates that HIV may contribute to lymphomagenesis by acting directly on B lymphocytes as a critical microenvironmental factor. The pathogenesis of EBV-associated lymphomas in patients with HIV infection is considered the result of the concerted action of different factors, mainly including impaired immune surveillance, genetic alterations, and concomitant viral infection (EBV and HIV). Summary Immunodeficiency states usually increase susceptibility to cancer as a result of reduced immune surveillance and enhanced chances for virus-driven oncogenesis. Lymphoma remains the most frequent neoplastic cause of death among patients infected with HIV. Several of the HIV-associated lymphomas are related to EBV infection.

Recent findings KSHV, a gammaherpesvirus, causes several tumors and related diseases, including Kaposi sarcoma, a form of multicentric Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD), and primary effusion lymphoma. These most often develop in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) is a newly describe nd syndrome with high mortality that has inflammatory symptoms-like MCD butot the pathologic lymph node findings. KSHV-associated diseases are often associated with dysregulated human interleukin-6, and KSHV encodes a viral interleukin-6, both of which contribute to disease pathogenesis. Treatment of HIV is important in HIV-infected patients. Strategies to prevent KSHV infection may reduce the incidence of these tumors. Pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, has activity in Kaposi sarcoma. Rituximab is active in KSHV-MCD but can cause Kaposi sarcoma exacerbation; rituximab plus liposomal doxorubicin is useful to treat KSHV-MCD patients with concurrent Kaposi sarcoma.

Women, however, continue to represent a vulnerable population at risk for certain ADM and NADM such as cervical, anal, and breast cancer. Human papillomavirus-mediated cancers disproportionately burden women in resource-poor settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. For cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer, women share a lower burden of disease compared with their male counterparts. However, there remains a dearth of evidence characterizing these disease states specifically among women.

Many of the cancers in HIV-infected children are linked to immunosuppression and oncogenic coinfections. Worldwide most HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa, but cancer data for this population are scarce. In this article, we review the current literature on the epidemiology and prevention of cancer in HIV-infected children. Recent findings Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces the risk of developing cancer in HIV-infected children. Cancer risk remains increased in children who start cART at older ages or more advanced immunosuppression as compared with children who start cART at younger age and with mild immunosuppression. Starting cART before severe immunosuppression develops is key to prevent cancer in HIV-infected children but most children in low-income countries start cART at severe immunosuppression levels. Vaccination against high-risk variants of human papillomavirus may protect again human papillomavirus-associated cancer later in life. However, tailoring of human papillomavirus vaccination guidelines for HIV-infected children and young women awaits answers to determine the best vaccination strategies.

The cancer and infectious disease epidemiology of HIV disease has markedly altered as populations are availed to the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The types of cancers occurring among those with HIV infection has broadened but the case burden in absolute numbers is very low relative to the background population. There are fewer incident cases of the AIDS-defining cancers (aggressive B-cell lymphomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cervical cancer). There is an increased risk for certain non-AIDS-defining cancers, but these occur somewhat sporadically relative to clinical trial enrollment. The changing epidemiology of cancer in HIV poses challenges as well as opportunities for participation of persons with HIV in cancer therapy clinical trials. Recent findings There are excellent examples of cancer trials that inform cancer therapy for patients with HIV infection. Examples include those from HIV-specific trials and from trials mainly focused on the background population that included patients with HIV infection. Summary Interpretation of clinical trials to guide therapy for those with HIV infection and cancer largely depends on data that does not include HIV-infected patients. The ability to extend clinical trial findings to populations not included in clinical trials remains problematic for a variety of populations, including those with HIV or AIDS. Careful prioritization of studies designed to bridge this gap is needed. However, there are published studies that serve as excellent examples bridging these gaps and the portfolio of cancer therapy trials underway will inform HIV and cancer better than at any time in the past.",2021,12,5,EE8IL,2020/1/15

Recent findings Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up is leading to epidemiologic transitions in LMIC similar to high-income countries, with aging and growth of HIV-infected populations, declining infectious deaths, increasing cancer deaths, and transitions from AIDS-defining cancers to non-AIDS defining cancers. Despite ART scale-up, the HIVAM burden remains high including an enormous AIDS-defining cancers burden in SSA. For Kaposi sarcoma, patients treated with ART and chemotherapy can experience good outcomes even in rural SSA, but Kaposi sarcoma heterogeneity remains insufficiently understood including virologic, immunologic, and inflammatory features that may be unique to LMIC. For cervical cancer, scale-up of prevention efforts including vaccination and screening is underway, with benefits already apparent despite continuing high disease burden. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, curative treatment is possible in the ART era even in SSA, and multifaceted approaches can improve outcomes further.

Recent findings Epigenetic drugs developed for cancer have been investigated in vitro, ex vivo and in clinical trials as interventions aimed at reversing HIV latency and depleting the amount of virus that persists on antiretroviral therapy. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors induced HIV expression in patients on antiretroviral therapy but did not reduce the frequency of infected cells. Other interventions that may accelerate the decay of latently infected cells, in the presence or absence of latency-reversing therapy, are now being explored. These include apoptosis-promoting agents, nonhistone deacetylase inhibitor compounds to reverse HIV latency and immunotherapy interventions to enhance antiviral immunity such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and Toll-like receptor agonists. Summary A curative strategy in HIV will likely need to both reduce the amount of virus that persists on antiretroviral therapy and improve anti-HIV immune surveillance.

CrustinPm1 inhibits only Gram-positive bacteria, while crustinPm7 acts against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work aims to characterize the molecular properties of recombinant crustinPm1 and crustinPm7, and the regulatory pathways of these two crustins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that crustinPm1 contained 40.81% alpha-helix and 22.34% beta-sheet, whereas crustinPm7 is made up of 32.86% alpha-helix and 27.53% beta-sheet. CrustinPm1 and crustinPm7 bound to phosphatidic acid (PA) with positive cooperativity of Hill slope (H) >2, indicating that at least two molecules of crustins bind with one PA molecule. It is worth noting that both crustins bound to PA with significantly higher affinity than to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We speculate that crustin might also achieve antimicrobial activity by targeting PA, a signaling lipid. Regulatory pathways of crustinPm1 and crustinPm7 were investigated by knockdown of PmRelish and PmMyD88. This study demonstrated that crustinPm1 is mediated through the Toll signaling pathway, while crustinPm7 is regulated via both Toll and Imd pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the first and rate limiting enzyme in CA synthesis. To develop an effective CA-related immunological defense system against stress and pathogen infection, various criteria, were evaluated in TH double-stranded (ds) RNA injected white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. Specifically, the relative transcript quantification of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), and other immune-related genes; TH activity in the haemolymph; and the estimation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), glucose, and lactate levels in the haemolymph were examined. TH depletion revealed a significant increase in the total haemocyte count; granular cells; semigranular cells; respiratory bursts (RBs, release of superoxide anion); superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity; phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency; and the expression of lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein and peroxinectin, SOD, crustin, and lysozyme genes. In addition, the reduction of TH gene expression and activity was accompanied by a decline of phenoloxidase (PO) activity per granulocyte, lower glucose and lactate levels, and significantly low expression of DBH and CHH genes. However, the number of hyaline cells, activity of PO, RBs per haemocyte, and expression of POI and POII genes were not significantly different in the LvTH-silenced shrimp. Notably, the survival ratio of LvTH-silenced shrimp was significantly higher than that of shrimp injected with diethyl pyrocarbonate water and nontargeting dsRNA when challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus.

Thioredoxin system is one of the principal factors that maintain the intracellular redox balance via its antioxidant property. In this study, we characterized two new thioredoxin isoforms (SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like) from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii. The molecular and structural characteristics, as well as the evolutionary relationships of SsTXN-like 1 and SsMtTXN-like confirmed that they belong to the thioredoxin superfamily. A classical thioredoxin domain was found in both proteins with a conserved redox-active site CXYC, however, only the precursor of SsMtTXN-like protein possessed a mitochondrial targeting signal. The results from insulin disulfide reduction activity assay demonstrated that their recombinant proteins are capable of reducing the disulfide bonds of oxidatively damaged proteins via their oxidoreductase activities. The free radical scavenging activity assay revealed the prominent hydroxyl and DPPH scavenging activities of rSsTXN-like I and rSsMtTXN-like in a dose-dependent manner.

Here, we found that Cxcl18b is chemotactic towards neutrophils, similarly to Cxcl8a/Interleukin-8, the best characterised neutrophil chemoattractant in humans and teleosts. Like Cxcl8a, Cxcl18b-dependent recruitment required the chemokine receptor Cxcr2, while it was unaffected by depletion of the other two neutrophil receptors cxcrl and cxcr4b. To visualise cxcl18b induction, we generated a Tg(cxcl18b:eGFP) reporter line. The transgene is induced locally upon bacterial infection with the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum, but strikingly is not directly expressed by infected cells. Instead, cxcl18b is induced by non-phagocytic uninfected cells that compose the stroma of the granulomas, typical inflammatory lesions formed upon mycobacterial infections.

SAV3 infected salmon showed increased SOCS1 mRNA levels in heart correlating with increased viral transcripts. Together, the in vitro and in vivo data suggests that SAV3-induced SOCS1 expression may affect the outcome of the virus infection.

The bacterial cell envelope of in vitro cultured and in vivo Burkholderia differed in structure, as in vivo bacteria lacked lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. The LPS O-antigen deficient bacteria had a reduced colonization rate in the host midgut compared with that of the wild-type Burkholderia. To determine why LPS O-antigen-deficient bacteria are less able to colonize the host midgut, we examined in vitro survival rates of three LPS O-antigen deficient Burkholderia mutants and lysates of five different midgut regions. The LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants were highly susceptible when cultured with the lysate of a specific first midgut region (M1), indicating that the M1 lysate contains unidentified substance(s) capable of killing LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants.

RT PCR was used to investigate differential gene expression in different tissues. The expression shown was greater in the pharynx. Single-nucleotide polymorphism has been investigated in Ciona intestinalis Tumor necrosis factor alpha (CiTNF alpha) mRNA isolated from the pharynx of 30 ascidians collected from Licata, Sicily (Italy), by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For this analysis, CiTNFa nucleotide sequence was separated into two fragments, TNF-1 and -2, respectively, of 630 and 540 bp. We defined 23 individual DGGE patterns (named 1 to 10 for TNF-1 and 1 to 13 for TNF-2). Five patterns for TNF-1 accounted for <10% of the individuals, whereas the pattern 13 of TNF-2 accounted for >20% of the individuals. All the patterns were verified by direct sequencing. Single base-pair mutations were observed mainly within COOH-terminus, leading to 30 nucleotide sequence variants and 30 different coding sequences segregating in two main different clusters. Although most of the base mutations were silent, four propeptide variants were detected and six amino acid replacements occurred within COOH-terminus. Statistical tests for neutrality indicated negative selection pressure on signal and mature peptide domains, but possible positive selection pressure on COOH-terminus domain. Lastly we displayed the in silico 3D structure analysis including the CiTNF alpha variable region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2021,67,10,EF1FR,2020/1/28

As an important member of TLRs family, TLR1 is mainly responsible for PAMPs from bacteria and play a pivotal role in sensing microbial products. Recent studies revealed that TLR1 could perceive LPS stimulation and transfer signals to activate the NF kappa B pathway, whereas ligands and signaling pathway of TLR1 are still unclear in fish. Growing evidence, has shown that miRNAs (microRNAs) play as negative regulators in controlling the diverse of biophysical and biochemical processes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we used a combination of bioinformatics and experimental techniques to exhibit that both miR-8159-5p and miR-217-5p were the direct negative regulators of TLR1 in miiuy croaker. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that combining miR-8159-5p and miR-217-5p exhibited a greater negative regulatory effect on TLR1 than only miR-8159-5p or miR-217-5p. Additionally, we also demonstrated that the expression of both the two miRNAs could be up-regulated by LPS stimulation in either LPS-stimulation spleen tissue or LPS-treated cultured macrophage, which indicating that miR-8159-5p and miR-217-5p could be induced by LPS and may be as the negative regulators of TLR1 involved in the immune response to LPS stimulation.

This large immunoregulatory receptor family also consists of multiple receptor-types with variable signaling abilities that is dependent on their inherent or acquired tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic tail (CYT) regions. For example, IpLITR 2.6b associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecule fpFcRy-L, and when expressed in mammalian cells it activates phagocytosis using a similar profile of intracellular signaling mediators that also regulate the prototypical mammalian Fc receptor (FcR) phagocytic pathway. Alternatively, IpLITR 1.1b contains a long tyrosine-containing CYT with multifunctional capabilities including both inhibitory and stimulatory actions. Recently, we demonstrated that IpLITR 1.1b activates a unique phagocytic pathway involving the generation of multiple plasma membrane extensions that rapidly capture extracellular targets and secure them on the cell surface in phagocytic cup-like structures. Occasionally, these captured targets are completely engulfed albeit at a significantly lower rate than what was observed for IpLITR 2.6b. While this novel IpLITR 1.1b phagocytic activity is insensitive to classical blockers of phagocytosis, its distinct target capture and engulfment actions depend on the engagement of the actin polymerization machinery. However, it is not known how this protein translates target recognition into intracellular signaling events during this atypical mode of phagocytosis. Using imaging flow cytometry and GST pulldown assays, the aims of this study were to specifically examine what regions of the IpLITR 1.1b CYT trigger phagocytosis and to establish what profile of intracellular signaling molecules likely participate in its actions. Our results show that in stably transfected AD293 cells, the membrane proximal and distal CYT segments of IpLITR 1.1b independently regulate its phagocytic activities. These CYT regions were also shown to differentially recruit various SH2 domain-containing intracellular Mediators, which provides new information about the dynamic immunoregulatory abilities of IpLITR 1.1b. Overall, this work further advances our understanding of how certain immunoregulatory receptor-types link extracellular target binding events to the actin polymerization machinery during anon-classical mode of phagocytosis.

ST2 sequences are known in several fish species, but none of them have functionally been examined. We characterised ST2 from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the structure of its encoding gene. The primary sequence of ST2 is only weakly conserved from fish to human. However, the amino acid sequences forming the interfaces for ST2 and MYD88 interaction are well conserved throughout evolution. High similarity of the gene segmentation unambiguously proves the common ancestry of fish and mammalian ST2. Trout ST2 and trout MYD88 genes were constitutively expressed in embryonic, larval and adult trout. In vivo infection with Aeromonas salmonicida did not modulate the mRNA levels of both factors. Overexpressing trout ST2 in the mammalian HEK-293 reconstitution system of TLR2 signalling quenched the Escherichia coli induced activation of NF-kappa B and SAA promoters in a dose -dependent fashion. The expression of GFP-tagged trout ST2 in human HEK-293 or trout CHSE-214 cells surprisingly revealed that (i) ST2 localised abundantly at the nuclear membrane rather than at the cell membrane and (ii) the coexpression of both ST2 and MYD88 allowed the translocation of trout MYD88 from cytoplasm to nucleus, as assessed using confocal microscopy and Western blotting. Hence, we validated that trout ST2 is a dampener of TLR signalling and interacts with MYD88. The spatial distribution of these factors raises questions about how this repressive mechanism functions.

In this study, we report that zebrafish STAT6 is induced during SVCV infection and reduces IFN phi 1 expression by suppressing TBK1 phosphorylation. A typical IFN stimulatory response element (ISRE) motif was found in the promoter region of zebrafish STAT6, and zebrafish STAT6 transcription was significantly upregulated in the early stages of virus infection. Overexpression of STAT6 interfered with IFN phi 1 promoter activity in response to SVCV infection. Additionally, TBK1-, but not MITA-mediated activation of the IFN phi 1 promoter was impaired by STAT6. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments indicated that MITA and IRF3 were significantly phosphorylated by TBK1, and that the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 was critical in this process. In the final step, STAT6 interacted with the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 causing dephosphorylation, which resulted in reductions in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the production of IFN phi 1. These results indicate that fish STAT6 can attenuate the kinase activity of TBK1, leading to suppression of IFN phi 1 expression which may in turn facilitate virus replication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These lectins are well-known AMPs which play important roles in fish defense mechanism. Here, we report a full-length lily type lectin-2 (LTL-2) identified from the cDNA library of striped murrel, Channa striatus (Cs). CsLTL-2 protein contained B-lectin domain along with three carbohydrate binding sites which is a prominent characteristic functional feature of LTL. The mRNA transcripts of CsLTL-2 were predominantly expressed in gills and considerably up-regulated upon infection with fungus (Aphanomyces invadans) and bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila). To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the carbohydrate binding region of CsLTL-2, the region was synthesized (QP13) and its bactericidal activity was analyzed. In addition, QP13 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and its binding affinity with the bacterial cell membranes was analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration assay revealed that QP13 inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 80 mu M/ml. Confocal microscopic observation showed that FITC tagged QP13 specifically bound to the bacterial membrane. Fluorescence assisted cell sorter (FACS) assay showed that QP13 reduced the bacterial cell count drastically. Therefore, the mechanism of action of QP13 on E. coli cells was determined by propidium iodide internalization assay which confirmed that QP13 induced bacterial membrane disruption. Moreover, the peptide did not show any cytotoxicity towards fish peripheral blood leucocytes. Taken together, these results support the potentiality of QP13 that can be used as an antimicrobial agent against the tested pathogens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphological classification of different hemocytes in mollusk has been studied since the 1970's, yet the involvement of the different sub-populations in immune functions is far from clear. In the present study, three types of hemocytes were morphologically identified and separated as agranulocytes, semi-granulocytes and granulocytes by flow cytometry and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The granulocytes were characterized functionally as the main phagocytic and encapsulating population, while semi-granulocytes and agranulocytes exhibited low or no such capacities, respectively. Meanwhile, the lysosome activity and the productions of ROS and NO were all mainly concentrated in granulocytes under both normal and immune-activated situations. Further, the mRNA transcripts of some immune related genes, including CgTLR, CgClathrin, CgATPeV, CgLysozyme, CgDefensin and CgIL-17, were mainly expressed in granulocytes, lower in semi-granulocytes and agranulocytes.

In this study, we characterized a snake-like serine protease, namely PmSnake, from the shrimp Penaeus monodon which has previously been identified based on the subtractive cDNA library of proPO double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-treated hemocytes. An open reading frame of PmSnake contains 1068 bp encoding a predicted protein of 355 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids and two conserved domains (N-terminal clip domain and C-terminal trypsin-like serine proteinase domain). Sequence analysis revealed that PmSnake was closest to the AeSnake from ant Acromyrmex echinatior (53% similarity), but was quite relatively distant from other shrimp PmclipSPs. PmSnake transcript was mainly expressed in shrimp hemocytes and up-regulated after systemic Vibrio harveyi infection indicating that it is an immune-responsive gene. Suppression of PmSnake expression by dsRNA interference reduced both transcript and protein levels leading to a reduction of the hemolymph phenoloxidase (PO) activity (36%), compared to the control, suggesting that the PmSnake functions as a clip-SP in shrimp proPO system. Western blot analysis using anti-PmSnake showed that the PmSnake was detected in hemocytes but not in cell-free plasma. In vitro PO activity and serine proteinase activity assays showed that adding rPmSnake into the shrimp hemolymph could increase PO activity as well as serine proteinase activity suggesting that the rPmSnake activates the proPO system via serine proteinase cascade.

AIV infection of macrophages was required to activate T lymphocytes and prior in vivo exposure of chickens to NP AIV plasrnid enhanced responses to infected macrophages. This study suggests that the demonstrated T lymphocyte activation is in part due to antigen presentation by the macrophages as well as cytokine release by the infected macrophages, with B2 haplotypes showing stronger activation. These responses were present both in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA showed greater IFN gamma release of B19 haplotype cells, further indicating the greater responses in B2 haplotypes to infection is due to macrophages, but not T cells.

Here we have further studied the defense specificity of FBN9 using a transgenic approach, in which FBN9 is overexpressed in the fat body tissue after a blood meal through a vitellogenin promoter. Interestingly, the Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes showed increased resistance only to the rodent parasite P. berghei, and not to the human parasite P. falciparum, pointing to differences in the mosquito's defense mechanisms against the two parasite species. The Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes were also more resistant to infection with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and showed increased longevity when infected with P. berghei.

The novel thermal preference aquarium was based upon a continuous vertical column system and allows for non-invasive observation of larvae vertical distribution under isothermal (T-R at 28 degrees C) and thermal gradient conditions (T-CH: 28-32 degrees C). Larval thermal preference was assessed under both conditions with or without an immersion challenge, in order to detect the onset of the behavioural fever response.

Bacterial infection increased the expression of PLA2, and the highest degree of up-regulation appeared in the fat body. Silencing PLA2 influenced the expression of immune-related genes, including MyD88 and defensin in the Toll pathway and relish and diptericin in the Imd pathway. Moreover, the expression of MyD88 and defensin was down-regulated significantly in the ds-PLA2 group compared with those in the ds-egfp group when B. dorsalis was infected with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, indicating that PLA2 was involved in the activation of the Toll pathway. Meanwhile, infection with L. monocytogenes and E. coli, which activate the Imd pathway, does not increase the mRNA levels of relish and diptericin in the ds-PLA2 group as severely as it increases those in the ds-egfp group, indicating that the Imd pathway was also repressed after silencing PLA2. Notably, the development of lipid droplets in fat body cells was influenced by silencing PLA2, implying that PLA2 affects the function of fat body tissue.

We show, for the first time, that cleaved transferrin products are produced in vivo early during an acute inflammatory response.

C1q-domain-containing proteins have multiple functions and occur extensively in invertebrates and vertebrates. In this study, PoC1 ql3 encoding a C1q-domain-containing protein in the Japanese flounder was identified. The 266-amino-acid polypeptide encoded, PoC1ql3, shares high sequence and structural similarity with orthologues in other fish and mammals. PoC1ql3 is abundantly expressed in the brain, but less in the blood, gills, and liver. Transcripts of PoC1ql3 were down-regulated in the spleen and liver 6-24 h after bacterial infection, but were significantly up-regulated after 48 h. Full-length PoC1ql3 (C1ql3-full) and its gC1q domain (C1ql3-part) were both exerted anti-Edwardsiella tarda activity. C1ql3-part bound to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, and exerted antibacterial effects against E. tarda in vivo, suggesting that C1ql3 functions as a pathogen-recognition receptor. Therefore, PoC1ql3 functions in the innate immune system, which would facilitate the investigation of the immune system in Japanese flounder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Its four CRDs with EPD/LSD, EPN/FAD, EPN/LND and EPN/YND key motifs were recombined separately. The recombinant proteins of CRD1 and CRD2 (designated as rCRD1 and rCRD2) could bind LPS and mannan, while the recombinant proteins of CRD3 and CRD4 (designated as rCRD3 and rCRD4) could bind LPS, PGN, mannan and glucan. Moreover, rCRD3 displayed broad microbe binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum, as well as fungi Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica. These results indicated CRD3 contributed more to CfLec-4's nonself-recognition ability. Furthermore, CRD1, CRD3 and CRD4 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in scallops. The sequence variation in Ca2+ binding site 2 among CRDs was suspected to be associated with such functional differentiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2021,67,7,EF1FR,2020/2/16

In the present study, a homolog of TRAIL from the Mongolian horse (named ecTRAIL) was identified and characterized. The 870-bp open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 289 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 33.47 kDa and pI of 8.47. The genomic structure of ecTRAIL shares a five-exon/six-intron arrangement similar to its orthologs. Multiple alignments show that ecTRAIL is a type II transmembrane protein with a typical transmembrane region, three conserved cysteine residues (Cys56, Cys77, Cys238) and a TNF family signature sequence ([LV]-x-[LIVM]-x(3)-G-[LIVMF]-Y-[LIVMFY](2)-x(2)-[QEKHL]-[LIVMGT]-x-[LIVMFY]). Three-dimensional structure prediction based on the same template revealed that the positional arrangement of the key amino acid residues, Cys238 and Cys230 in ecTRAIL and human TRAIL, respectively, is significantly conserved. Evolutionary analysis suggests that ecTRAIL is most closely related to its ortholog from pigs, with an identity of 83.99%. The solubilizing small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag fused recombinant protein SUMO-ecsTRAIL was successfully expressed in E. coli and exhibited binding activity and cytotoxicity to HeLa cells in a cross-species manner in vitro. These results provide a better understanding of TRAILs in mammals and indicate that ecTRAIL may play an important role in the immune response in horses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We showed that carp Il10 is able to downregulate proinflammatory activities by carp phagocytes and promote B cell proliferation, differentiation and antibody production as well as proliferation of memory T cells. Taking advantage of the recent annotation of the carp genome, we completed the sequence of a second il10 paralogue, named il10b, the presence of which was expected owing to the recent (8 million years ago) fourth round of whole genome duplication that occurred in common carp. In the present study we closely compared the two Il10 paralogues and show that Il10a and Il10b have almost identical gene structure, synteny, protein sequence as well as bioactivity on phagocytes. Although the two il10 paralogues show a large overlap in tissue expression, il10b has a low constitutive expression and is highly upregulated upon infection, whereas il10a is higher expressed under basal conditions but its gene expression remains constant during viral and parasitic infections. This differential regulation is most likely due to the observed differences in their promoter regions. Altogether our results demonstrate that gene duplication in carp, although recent, led to sub-functionalization and expression divergence rather than functional redundancy of the Il10 paralqgues, yet with very similar protein sequences.

Multiple alignment analysis shows that the putative amino acid sequence of Sp-TRAf6 has highest identity of 88% with Pt-TRAF6 from Portunus trituberculatus, while the similarity of Sp-TRAF6 with other crustacean sequences was 54-55%. RT-PCR analysis indicated that Sp-TRAF6 transcripts were predominantly expressed in the hepatopancreas and stomach, whereas it was barely detected in the heart and hemocytes in our study. Moreover, Sp-TRAF6 transcripts were significantly up regulated after Vibrio parahemolyticus and LPS challenges. RNA interference assay was carried out used by siRNA to investigate the genes expression patterns regulated by Sp-TRAF6. The qRT-PCR results showed that silencing Sp-TRAF6 gene could inhibit SpALF1, SpALF2, SpALF5 and SpALF6 expression in hemocytes, while inhibit SpALF1, SpALF3, SpALF4, SpALF5 and SpALF6 expression in hepatopancreas. Taken together, the acute-phase response to immune challenges and the inhibition of SpALEs gene expression indicate that Sp-TRAF6 plays an important role in host defense against pathogen invasions via regulation of ALF gene expression in S. paramamosain.

The mRNA levels of IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B in the immune cells examined were highest in macrophage and monocytes. Assessment of spleen mRNA following infection with Trypanosoma carassii, a prominent protozoan pathogen of fish, revealed decrease in IL-4/13B and arginase expression 14 days post infection, followed by an increase in IL-4/13B and arginase-2 at 28 days post infection. Recombinant forms of IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B induced an increase in arginase activity in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner.

The neutralizing antibody titer of fish serum mostly corresponded to the survival rate of immunized fish in the NNV challenge test. Extravascular IgM(+) cells were detected in the brains of both NNV-infected and noninfected groupers. After NNV infection, CD8 alpha and IgM gene expression increased in the brains, indicating CD8 alpha(+) and IgM(+) lymphocyte infiltration. Moreover, the NNV load was not the highest in dead grouper brains, suggesting that this load in the brain was not the key factor for the death of groupers. However, the brains of dead fish showed the highest expression of the interleukin (IL)-1 beta gene, a neurotoxic factor in the brain.

We found that the European Common Frog Rana temporaria expresses a protein in its skin that is evolutionarily related to the host-defense protein S100A7. This prompted us to test if the encoded protein, which is an important microbicidal protein in human skin, shows similar activity in frogs. The R. temporaria protein lacks the zinc-binding sites that are key to the antimicrobial activity of human S100A7 at neutral pH. However, despite being less potent, the R. temporaria protein does compromise bacterial membranes at low pH, similar to its human counterpart.

However, planarian immune system remains poorly understood. In this paper, a novel C-type lectin-like protein, namely, DjCTL was identified and characterized in Dugesia japonica. DjCTL was mainly expressed in the pharyngeal and epidermis and up-regulated upon the induction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria indicating that DjCTL may be involved in the immune responses. Recombination DjCTL protein agglomerated rabbit red blood cells and interacted with LPS, PGN, mannose and galactose as well as both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but it can only cause the agglutination of Gram-negative bacteria. Importantly, in the early periods of regeneration, DjCTL had a significantly high expression and was mainly expressed in early blastemas. RNA interference of DjCTL by dsRNA-DjCTL led to a slow wound healing during regeneration. These findings suggest that DjCTL participates in the innate immune response and plays an important role in early stages of regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that microsporidia carried by H. axyridis can kill A. bipunctata following the oral uptake of spores, suggesting that their horizontal transmission via intraguild predation may help the invader to outcompete its native competitor. The native seven-spotted ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata) is thought to be less susceptible both to the spread of H. axyridis and to its microsporidia. To investigate whether the distinct levels of pathogen susceptibility in these three ladybird species are determined by their immune systems, we compared the immunity-related transcriptomes of untreated beetles and beetles challenged with suspensions of bacteria and yeast. We found that H. axyridis carries three and four times as many genes encoding antimicrobial peptides representing the attacin, coleoptericin and defensin families than C. septempunctata and A. bipunctata, respectively. Gene expression studies following the injection of bacteria and yeasts into beetles revealed that members of these three antimicrobial peptide families are also induced more strongly in H. axyridis than C septempunctata or A. bipunctata.

The expression signatures of apolipoproteins in channel catfish were determined in healthy tissues and after infections with two major bacterial pathogens, Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium columnare. In healthy channel catfish, most apolipoprotein genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns in channel catfish. After ESC and columnaris infections, 5 and 7 apolipoprotein genes were differentially expressed respectively, which presented a pathogen-specific and time-dependent pattern of regulation. After ESC infection, three exchangeable apolipoproteins (apoA-IB, apoC-I, and apoE-B) were suppressed in catfish intestine, while two nonexchangeable apolipoproteins (apoB-A and apoB-B) were slightly up regulated. After columnaris infection, apoB-B, apoD-B, and apoE-A were significantly down-regulated in catfish gill, while apoF, apoL-IV, apoO-like, and apo-14 kDa showed significantly up-regulation.

The signaling molecules (LAX1, BLK) and transcription factors (GATA3, FOXP3) are expressed at high levels. High expression of GATA3 transcription factor at birth seems to skew the neonatal immune response towards TH2 type. The high levels of T-cell signaling molecules, CD3G and CD3D, at birth are important in neonatal T cell development. Unlike adults, IGKC expression is high in the neonates where IGKV12 is preferentially expressed at birth.

The reactor contains 1.95 g of TiO2 in contact with the air stream per liter of reactor volume and the illuminated catalyst surface area, in contact with the gas phase, per reactor volume was calculated to be 349 m(2) m(-3), which is similar to 1.4 times higher than that obtained for an annular photoreactor packed with CA monolithic structures coated with TiO2-P25. The PCO reaction rate, r(dec), was assessed under different experimental conditions: amount of TiO2 supported in CA sheets, n-decane feed concentration, feed flow rate, relative humidity and UV irradiance. The highest r(dec) value (0.82 mu mol min(-1)) was achieved when the following conditions were employed: mTiO(2) = 75 mg, C-dec,C-feed = 131 x 10(-2) mol m(-3), Q(feed) = 220 cm(3) min(-1) and I = 38.4 W m(-2). The maximum reactivity of photocatalyst in combination with the photoreactor was 6.93 x 10(-4) mol m(reactor)(-3) s(-1), which is a 21.4 fold increase when compared with the annular photoreactor, highlighting the enhancement of mass and photons transfer.

The coupling of the two processes can take place inside a single apparatus or using separate units. If a single apparatus is utilized, the coupling is more direct, but separate units offer higher degrees of freedom for the design with more opportunities to optimize the system without constraints. However, when using separate units, the integration of the two unit operations depends largely on the parameters intervening in the coupling procedure. These parameters are the recycle ratio, R, if a recycle stream is used to backmix part of the exiting stream, or the number, N, of blocks if the volume of the reaction and the membrane area are fractionated into multiple reaction-separation blocks. The possibility of different combinations of these two basic methods is also presented. The case study to illustrate the effect of the various parameters (R, N, the Damkohler number and the Peclet number) and to find the proper operating conditions is the photocatalytic green synthesis of an aromatic aldehyde, which is recovered from the reaction solution by a pervaporation process to avoid further oxidation. The results show that process intensification is the result of appropriately choosing the reaction system and operating conditions because these factors may substantially increase the yield.

The influence of inorganic ions on the permeate flux was dependent on their concentration and was more significant at higher salts content. The HCO3- ions contributed to the permeate flux decline to the highest extent, which was attributed to both a higher feed pH and a formation of a dense fouling layer. In the presence of SO42- the permeate flux was higher than in case of other ions which was explained in terms of lower thickness of the fouling cake caused by repulsion of TiO2 particles by the membrane under such conditions. The most severe decrease of the permeate flux observed in the presence of a mixture of HAs and inorganic salts was attributed to the formation of a thick fouling cake caused by bridging effect between HAs molecules and TiO2 particles under high ionic strength conditions. The inorganic salts contributed also to a decrease of HAs decomposition rate due to the hole and hydroxyl radicals scavenging effect of the ions. It was found that the conditions prevailing in the PMR contributed to the loss of the membrane separation properties towards dextrans due to the abrasive action of TiO2 particles. However, the extent of the observed decrease in the dextrans rejection was dependent on the feed composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2021,310,8,EF1GL,2020/3/9

The model includes the rigorous description of the hydrodynamics, radiation transfer, mass transport and chemical reaction rate based on a mechanistic kinetic model. Possible existence of dead and recirculation zones has been identified from the flow field, showing a non-uniform flow through the reactor domain. The theoretical laminar profile is not reached due to the short length of the annular core and the departure from the ideal models has been quantified. The predicted velocity field has been experimentally validated with good agreement by injecting a tracer. The radiation field was simulated for slurry TiO2 suspensions with concentrations between 0.005 and 5 g.L-1, showing an optimum catalyst loading around 0.1-0.2 g.L-1. Above this value, the increase in the absorption of radiation is negligible, whereas a more non-uniform radiation profile develops, keeping the most external regions of the reactor in the dark. The results of photocatalytic activity, using methanol oxidation as test reaction, showed good agreement between model predictions and experimental data, with errors between 2% and 10% depending on the catalyst concentration. The successful validation confirms not only the scientific background of the model, but also supports its applicability for engineering purposes in the design and optimization of large scale photocatalytic reactor to overcome some of limitations hindering the industrial development of this technology.

In immobilized films, two irradiation mechanisms can be encountered, i.e., backside illumination (BSI) and front-side illumination (FSI). In, each case, different concentration profiles develop within the porous matrix and, therefore, distinct optimal conditions are expected. Predicting the optimal film thickness is an important parameter in algorithms for immobilized photocatalytic reactor overall optimization. In this work, we have proposed explicit equations for the prediction of the best film thickness for the BSI and FSI mechanisms as a function of the incident irradiation (I-lambda,I-0), the apparent first-order reaction constant (k(r,app)), the effective diffusivity (D-eff) and the absorption coefficient (K-lambda).

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the mixed graphene dioxide (GO) was reduced during PAHD coating of TiO2-GO nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed TiO2 presented as a mixture phase of anatase, rutile and brookite in the TiO2-rGO nanocomposites. UV- vis absorption spectra of TiO2-rGO nanocomposites indicated that mixing rGO into TiO2 particles could reduce band gap energy, thereby enhancing utilization efficiency of visible light. Photocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposites was measured by the degradation of three pharmaceuticals under UV and visible light irradiation, including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole. TiO2-rGO nanocomposites exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activities as compared to pure TiO2, and were strongly affected by the amount of rGO in the catalysts. While photocatalysis with 2.7% rGO achieved 54% degradation of carbamazepine, 81% of ibuprofen, and 92% of sulfamethoxazole after 180 min UV irradiation, the mineralization rates of the pharmaceuticals were similar between 52% and 59%. The photocatalytic oxidation of pharmaceuticals by the prepared nanocomposites followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. There was an obvious positive correlation between degradation rate constant and quantum flux for both UV and visible light, with correlation coefficient of 0.991. In addition, long-term photoactivity testing of TiO2-rGO coated SOFs demonstrated the durability of the immobilized TiO2-rGO nanocomposites on optical fibers for water treatment.

In the absence of glycine, pure anatase and brookite phases were selectively prepared via simply adjusting the initial pH value with NH4OH or NaOH. The as-synthesized photocatalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), photoluminescence (PL), surface area measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The XRD revealed that brookite content decreased in ABH samples with glycine concentration increased. The prepared TiO2 nanoparticles have mesostructure with large surface area values ranging from 27.9 to 62.3 m(2) g(-1). SEM images showed spindle-like brookite structure and rod-like brookite mixed with small anatase particle obtained in the absence and presence of glycine, respectively.

The activities of as-prepared TiO2 photocatalysts were evaluated for the degradation of cylindrospermopsin (CYN) under UV-Vis light. Complete CYN degradation (100%) from aqueous solution with initial rate of 175 x 10(-3) mu M min(-1) was achieved under UV-Vis light irradiation within 15 min.

This paper examines the photochemical decomposition of EDCs, including direct photolysis, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and photosensitized oxidation (Pox). Particular attention was focused on photocatalytic and photosensitized degradation processes. The most important portions of the report concern the photodegradation of six groups of EDCs: natural hormones and steroids, alkylphenols and bisphenol A, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, preservatives, pesticides and phthalates. Two new trends in photocatalytic degradation are the immobilization and modification of photocatalysts, which result in eliminating the problem of removing the photocatalyst slurry from purified water and improving the ability to activate photocatalyst in the visible radiation. Photochemical oxidation, particularly using molecular oxygen, is unquestionably one of the most important photochemical methods because photochemical oxidation does not require additional oxidizers such as ozone or hydrogen peroxide or any additional energy input as are required in cases of ozonation or UV irradiation. The primary reactant formed during photosensitized oxidation is exceptionally reactive species - molecular singlet oxygen. Although AOPs are effective in removing EDCs from aqueous solutions, the costs of these processes are high; therefore, an interesting option among the photochemical processes appears to be immobilization of the photocatalyst or photosensitizer and using these processes in visible light.

Changes in solution pH were used to decouple the effects of NOM on adsorption and major oxidative mechanisms, e.g., reactions on the surface of the photocatalytic spheres via positive hole (h(+)) mediation as well as in the solution via hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) reaction. At pH 3, highly electrostatic attraction between solutes (2,4-D and NOM) and photocatalyst surface caused increasing adsorption and consequently photocatalytic oxidation which mostly occurred via charge transfer on the surface of the spheres. At pH 7, on the other hand, electrostatic repulsion between solutes and photocatalyst surface reduced the adsorption and the process was primarily driven by hydroxyl radical attacks. With the aid of methanol as an (OH)-O-center dot scavenger, it was determined that at neutral pH, due to higher aromatic moieties concentration and lower NOM adsorption, the effect of NOM on scavenging (OH)-O-center dot was considerable. This effect dramatically decreased at low pH due to high adsorption of NOM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2021,310,7,EF1GL,2020/3/17

The photo-Fenton process is efficient in persistent organic pollutant degradation and the use of low cost reactors with variable light path length such as raceway pond reactors (RPR) has been recently proposed. The aim of the study was to develop a simplified kinetic model predicting micropollutant removal rate as a function of environmental variables (irradiance and temperature), geometrical variables (light path length) and operating variables (reactant concentration). The parameters were obtained by fitting the model to 36 experimental conditions in 1.25-L cylindrical reactors at lab scale and then validated in a 360-L RPR at pilot plant scale. In the studied range, 10-40 degrees C, temperature enhances the photo-Fenton reaction rate by: i) accelerating the oxidation of ferrous iron with hydrogen peroxide (thermal Fenton); and ii) making the light absorption coefficient of ferric iron higher, that is the VRPA. The proposed photo-Fenton model takes into account both effects and properly fit experimental data. Considering 90% removal of the pesticide acetamiprid at an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L, a treatment capacity of 135 mg/m(2) h was achieved with low reactant concentrations, 10 mg/L Fe2+ and 50 mg/L H2O2.

Under the given conditions, 51%, 42% and 35% of COD removal was achieved using respectively Fe(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) as catalysts. Different UV sources were tested with the previously selected optimal conditions in order to increase the treatment efficiency. The highest COD removal (82%) was achieved using a UV-A LEDs system (70 W/m(2)). These conditions were also promising for the treatment of WW with COD concentrations of 5000 mg O-2/L, reaching 79% and 64% of COD and TOC removal, respectively, after 180 min of treatment. At 323 K, the most effective treatment was obtained when Co(II) was used as catalyst (79% and 64% of COD and TOC removal), while at ambient temperature (293 K) the highest COD (65%) and TOC (52%) removals were obtained with Fe(II) catalyst. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the use of HSO5-/Mn+ in several consecutive doses was more efficient than adding the reagents as a single dose at the beginning of the reaction.

The assays were made in a flow plant of 2.5 L equipped with a boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion cell and a solar planar photoreactor. Main oxidants were hydroxyl radicals formed from water discharge at the BDD anode and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction between added Fe2+ and cathodically generated H2O2. Partial mineralization was achieved for all the treatments, with the relative oxidation ability growing in the sequence: AO-H2O2 < EF < SPEF. The superiority of SPEF over EF was related to the contribution of photo-oxidation of intermediates and/or their Fe(III) complexes upon sunlight irradiation. No short-linear carboxylic acids were identified, whereas heteroatoms were mainly released as NO3- and SO42- ions. For herbicide contents <= 0.18 mM in EF and SPEF, a very rapid pseudo-first-order decay kinetics was related to the oxidation of the Fe(II) complexes of each herbicide at short time, whereupon a much slower pseudo-first-order kinetics associated with the decay of their Fe(III) complexes was observed. Ametryn disappeared more quickly than tebuthiuron, but its solutions were more poorly mineralized. The effect of j and substrate concentration on the performance of SPEF was examined. Mixtures of both formulations were efficiently treated by SPEF, showing similar but slower decays than single solutions.

However, the practical/corn mercial/industrial applications of photocatalysis have been restricted in the field of building materials. The low quantum efficiency in solar energy conversion and limitation of low level of pollutants in photodegradation are very difficult to solve. Air purification by photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of various pollutants, for example volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or inorganic gaseous (NOx, SOx, CO, H2S and ozone, etc) at reasonably low concentrations, appears to be more feasible for commercialization. This review firstly introduces the removal mechanism of these contaminations by PCO, and then provides detailed survey and discussion on both photocatalysts and reactor design. This paper aims to deliver fundamental and comprehensive information for paving the venue of gas-phase photodegradation to commercialized air purification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the textural, morphological and structural properties of plate shaped composites calcined at different temperatures on the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of formaldehyde in gas phase is analyzed. Silicates allows TiO2 extrusion into flat plates with a content of 50 wt% of titania. All shaped materials present adequate mechanical resistance to be scaled-up for use in continuous-flow gas-phase catalytic reactors. Thermal treatment at 500 degrees C ensures an optimum combination of mechanical, textural and HCHO adsorption properties. The silicates cover part of the TiO2 particles thus reducing the fraction of TiO2 actually exposed on the surface of the composites, essential to carried out the photocatalytic process, but they also allow controlling TiO2 dispersion and the amount of HCHO adsorbed. The HCHO degradation rate is enhanced with all the silicate-TiO2 composites with respect to that of the benchmark TiO2. The incorporation of titania into the silicate matrix favors the gas phase removal of HCHO in the following sequence: MTi > KTi > STi > BTi > TiO2. The exposed fraction of titania particles and the size of the TiO2 anatase crystalline domains determine the efficiency of the hybrid material, which is optimized in high-aluminum kaolinite and mordenite based hybrids.

The resulting composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the composites was evaluated using NO as a target inorganic air pollutant. Variation of the initial weight ratio of melamine precursor/TiO2 (3:1, 1:1, 2:3, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:7) allowed tuning of the composites' band gap from 2.66 eV in pure g-C3N4 to 3.14 eV in pure P25 as revealed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The conduction band edges position determined by electrochemical measurements using Mott-Schottky relation varied from similar to-1.27 eV in pure g-C3N4 to similar to-0.67 eV in pure P25 (vs NHE, pH 7). Under visible light, the g-C3N4/TiO2 composite with initial ratio 1:4 exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in NO oxidation in comparison to the pure semiconductors g-C3N4 and TiO2.

Results clearly demonstrate that SASW is a very efficient approach in the treatment of soil, removing completely the petrochemical compounds by using dosages about 5 g of extracting surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) per kg of soil. The main characteristics of the effluents produced in this soil remediation technology as well as the efficiency of the treatment (US, photolysis and BDD-electrolysis) depend on the dosage of SDS. Depollution of the effluents (degradation and mineralization of the organic matter) is related to the reduction in size of micelles formed by SDS and petroleum, and it depends on the treatment used. US and photolysis were inefficient decontamination processes, while BDD-electrolysis favors the complete depletion of micelles. However, the intensification of the efficiency was attained by synergic degradation effects when UV light irradiation and US were coupled with BDD-electrolysis, US/BDD-electrolysis and photo/BDD-electrolysis, respectively. Sulfate (coming from SDS) ions play an important role during the BDD-electrolysis, US/BDD-electrolysis and photo/BDD-electrolysis because persulfate and persulfate radicals are produced (by sulfate activation, applying US or photolysis), improving the efficiency of the processes.

In this case, the controller gains vary with respect to system variables, leading to inner loops between the system and the linearized gain-scheduled controller dynamics. Such effects, also known as parasitic feedbacks, are inherently difficult to handle in classic gain-scheduling control design and are often omitted, which might result in performance degradations or even destabilization of the closed-loop system. This paper shows how such a pitfall can be avoided through the application of self-scheduling and eigenstructure assignment techniques.

Given that the MICA is an unsupervised modeling method, a direct rational study that can conclusively demonstrate which non-quadratic function is optimal for the general purpose of fault detection is inaccessible.

Recognition of this issue and motivated by the superiority of ensemble learning strategy, a novel ensemble MICA (EMICA) modeling approach is presented for enhancing non-Gaussian process monitoring performance. Instead of focusing on a single non-quadratic function, the proposed method combines multiple base MICA models derived from different non-quadratic functions into an ensemble one, and the Bayesian inference is employed as a decision fusion method to form a unique monitoring index for fault detection.

A common therapy for ARDS patients is mechanical ventilation (MV). However, poorly applied MV can be potentially fatal and optimal MV settings are patient specific. Thus, choosing a good positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)-level compromise is a clinical challenge. Physiological modeling of the lung is one way to support the selection of the optimal settings for mechanical ventilation. This research makes the reasonably well-supported assumption that optimal PEEP is in the region of minimal elastance of the lung-tissue. The first order model of pulmonary mechanics (FOM) was modified in two differing ways in order to determine the patient-specific pressure range that coincides with minimal elastance. The extensions to the FOM (multiplicative elastance correction and additive volume correction parameters) are compared and evaluated. The addition of the correction parameters ultimately improved the consistency of the modeled elastance across PEEP levels for most patients tested. The results for minimal elastance were in very similar ranges for both approaches. Although this consistency offers a partial validation of the robustness of the approaches, discernment of the optimal approach cannot be determined. Further validation across differing patient states and experimental inputs must be undertaken to determine which method is more representative of true patient physiology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In some electronic hardware implementations, only two electrodes inject current simultaneously, and are denominated pair-wise current injection. Several possibilities of pair-wise current injection (electric current patterns) and electric potential, measurement (single-ended and differential) have been addressed in the literature. Considering pair-wise current injection, the skip-m current pattern can be defined as a pair-wise injection strategy in which the number of non-current injecting electrodes enclosed between two injection electrodes is m. Single-ended electric potential Measurements consist of measurements with a common potential reference. Differential electric potential measurements consist of pair-wise measurements between two electrodes. A theoretical analysis based on control theory is presented to show that some current and measurement pattern strategies convey less information than others. This hypothesis is verified by the analysis of the matrix containing possible measurement vectors, with respect to its rank, condition number and singular values. Additionally, a novel approach is proposed to analyse current and measurement patterns based on uncertainty estimation of difference images by the correlation matrix linearization of the reconstructed impedance matrix. The results show that single-ended potential measurements are usually better when compared to differential electric potential measurements. A conclusion supported by both points of view is that the cross current pattern (diametral) is the least informative for these symmetrical domains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Event detection, removal of ambient noise, and characterisation of audible squeaking is investigated. Fundamental implant frequencies from squeaking are within 2-5 kHz, with several harmonics also present. Several event detection methods are investigated, including a statistical method based upon sound intensity, wavelet analysis and a Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) variation method. All methods can effectively identify most events, with the wavelet approach being the most effective, and the RMS method the most computationally demanding. The identified events are then utilised to determine the baseline ambient noise characteristics, which are then removed from the signal to increase the clarity of frequency peaks. Comparisons are made between the in-vivo tests and the subsequent in-vitro results, with a clear correlation between the two test methods. In-vivo signals were notably lower magnitude than recordings from subsequent in-vitro laboratory tests made on the implant directly.

EPAIA employs a rotary pneumatic actuator to provide an adjustable compliant element in series to the gear train. The compliant element is thereby inserted between a brushless direct current motor, a gear reduction and the load. The decentralised control system consists of two control-loops and a decoupler. In a first control-loop, the interaction torque between actuator and load is controlled with a cascaded/post-compensator architecture involving a norm-optimal strictly positive-real H-2-controller to minimise the actuator output impedance. In a second control-loop, a stiffness controller continuously adjusts the pressure of the pneumatic chambers to realise a certain interaction stiffness. Since first hardware validation tests identified the occurrence of nonlinear friction effects that worsened the control performance, the control strategy has been extended with a new adaptive friction compensation scheme. This approach is based on the two-state dynamic friction model with elasto-plasticity (2SEP) for which an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) friction observer has been developed and incorporated to the decentralised control strategy.

The torque controller, cascaded with an inner motor velocity control loop, is based on H-infinity criterion to achieve good system performance with relation to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The impedance control is implemented using a PD position controller in cascade with the torque controller, where the outer position controller determines the desired torque according to position and velocity errors and impedance parameters.

The second model structure is an autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model, i.e. a model without an integrator. The third model structure is an adaptive ARMAX model in which we use a recursive extended least squares (RELS) method to estimate parameters of the stochastic part. In addition, we describe some safety layers in the control algorithm that improve the controller robustness and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. We test and compare our control strategies using a virtual clinic of 100 randomly generated patients with a representative inter subject variability. This virtual clinic is based on the Hovorka model.

Surface chemistry properties such as the nature and the amount of functional groups were studied through various characterization techniques. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of the modified samples were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. It is shown that anodic polarization leads to a significant oxidation of the pristine carbon material, characterized by the substantial incorporation of a wide variety of oxygenated groups and a significant modification of the porous network. A capacitance increase is highlighted for the anodically polarized samples and can be attributed to the incorporation of CO-type surface groups. While cathodic polarization leads to a slight modification in surface chemistry and nanotexture, anodic treatment causes noticeable transformations of the pristine carbon material. Additionally, the oxidation phenomenon which occurs at the carbon electrode appears to be quite different in the two modes.

The target species including N-heterocyclic pollutants (pyrrole, pyrimidine and pyridine), Humic Substances and salt of sodium sulfate were removed from the simulated wastewater by this process. Within electrocatalysis, pyrrole and pyrimidine were degraded prior to pyridine due to their lower Gibbs energy barriers as 6.79 kcal and 16.89 kcal, respectively, and thus were easier attacked by hydroxyl radical generated on the electrode surface.

However, biochar is less effective than activated carbon in immobilising contaminants. To increase the efficiency of contaminant binding by biochar, an alternative method of biochar activation that leads to an increase in surface area is proposed. Herein, we improve the biochar by subjection to a range of activation techniques using microwaves, carbon dioxide or superheated steam. To test their effectiveness, the untreated and activated biochars were added at 5% w/w into three different industrially contaminated soils sampled from areas around a coal plant (KOK and KB) and a bitumen processing plant (POPI). The surface area (SSA) of biochar subjected to the activation techniques increased significantly. The SSA of the original biochar was 11 m(2)/g, while those of the activated biochars was 443 m(2)/g (microwave), 512 m(2)/g (CO2) and 841 m(2)/g (superheated steam). The addition of activated biochar reduced the freely dissolved PAHs (C-free in the KOK and POPI soils by up to 86% (from 153 to 22 ng/L and from 172 to 24 ng/L, respectively) and in the KB soil by up to 70% (from 52 to 16 ng/L) compared to the untreated soils.

Nowadays, the use of PMS has acquired popularity thanks to its high reactivity and also to its high potential in generating sulfate radical.

In the present work, we report numerical simulations of liquid-liquid flow in a continuous gravity settler and their experimental validation. The twoPhaseEulerFoam module available in open source CFD code OpenFOAM was developed further to simulate three-phase flow of aqueous and organic phases in a continuous gravity settler with free gas region at top (freeboard region). The predicted dispersion band thickness and spatial variation of organic phase volume fraction were verified using the measurements performed in a laboratory-scale settler. While the measured and predicted dispersion band thickness agreed well, owing to the constant drop size considered in the present work, the predicted organic phase volume fraction was found to be lower than the measurements. The effects of liquid flow rate, drop diameter, inlet baffle position and organic phase density were investigated. With the increase in drop diameter, interestingly, it was found that the dispersion band thickness was reduced and significant fluctuations in the local organic phase volume fraction were observed. The fluctuations were found to decrease with increase in the total liquid flow rate. The experimentally validated computational model will be useful in designing large-scale continuous gravity settlers and optimize their separation performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a novel two-step strategy has been built to prepare new KF (KF-PDA-GO) with remarkably improved integrated performances by forming polydopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) bi-layer coatings on the surfaces of KFs. Orthogonal tests based on three factors and three levels were designed and carried out to systematically study the influences of dopamine (DA) concentration, GO concentration and reaction temperature on the structure and performances of KF-PDA-GO fibers. Results show that the reaction temperature is the decisive factor for both surface active and UV resistance. All KF-PDA-GO fibers not only have greatly improved surface activity and UV resistance, overcoming the two intractable disadvantages of KFs, but also show outstanding thermal resistance and higher tensile properties including tensile strength, modulus, elongation and break energy. For the new fiber (KF-PDA-GO3) prepared with the optimum conditions, its surface free energy increases 54%, meanwhile the retention of tensile strength after 168 h-UV irradiation is as high as 93.4%, almost the best value among the latest modified KF fibers reported. Different failure modes are found between original and modified KF fibers through intensively discussing the morphological and chemical structures of fibers. This investigation provides a novel and facile method to develop new KF fibers with higher integrated performances, especially outstanding surface activity, UV resistance, thermal and mechanical properties.

In this study, we evaluated CBZ degradation by light-emitting diode (LED)-driven UV/chlorine oxidation. Under LED irradiation of 280 nm (LED280) and 310 nm (LED310), UV/chlorine could efficiently degrade CBZ. Compared with LED UV/H2O2 treatment, LED UV/chlorine oxidation achieved a CBZ degradation rate that was one order of magnitude higher. The CBZ degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the rate constants (k(obs,CBZ)) for LED280 UV/chlorine and LED310 UV/chlorine increased from 0.072 to 0.91 min(-1) and 0.044 to 0.65 min-1, respectively, when chlorine dosage increased from 0.07 to 0.14 mM. Under neutral conditions, the generated center dot OH and center dot Cl accounted for over 80% of the CBZ degraded by LED UV/chlorine. The maximum k(obs,CBZ) for LED UV/chlorine was observed at pH 8.5; k(obs,CBZ) decreased when solution pH increased to 9.5 or decreased to 5.5. This is because the main UV-absorbing chlorine species in the LED280 and LED310 systems is OCl-, which is different from those in low-pressure mercury lamp/chlorine systems. The acute toxicity for CBZ solution treated by LED UV/chlorine increased at lower fluence (<752 mJ/cm(2)) and decreased at higher fluence (>1233 mJ/cm(2)). However, the cytotoxicity to Chinese hamster ovary cells and adsorbable organic halide content of CBZ solution both increased after chlorination and LED UV/chlorine.

As-made MgO was a nanocrystalline nanoparticle with BET specific surface area of 257.3 m(2)/g and a high density of basic surface functional groups.

Herein, we demonstrate a one-pot solvothermal method for fabricating NiFe2O4-carbon dot (NiFeC) nanocomposites, which solve its limitations and mitigate the usual fabrication drawbacks by self-assembly such as relatively weak interaction, time-consuming and lack of recycling potential. Series characterizations confirmed the successful fabrication of NiFeC nanocomposites with great uniformity in morphology and exhibited excellent dispersibility in water. The adsorption behavior of the as-prepared nanocomposites was systematically studied using kinetic and equilibrium experiments.

Three kinds of carbonates including bicarbonate, bidentate and monodentate carbonate are formed during the adsorption process, indicating a synergistic adsorption mechanism for CO2. For the dynamic CO2 adsorption without water vapor, the adsorption capacity decreases in the order of Mg/Al-0.2 > Mg/Al-0.3 > Mg/Al-0.1 > Mg/Al-0, which coincides with the trend of the amount of basic sites; especially, Mg/Al-0.2 with the Mg/Al molar ratio of 0.2 shows a stable adsorption capacity of 1.60 mmol/g without loss after 11 cycles at 60 degrees C.

The Limestone Chemical Looping Combustion process (LCL-C (TM)) registered by Alstom Power Inc. proposes the use of a continuous CaCO3 feeding together with coal to produce CaSO4 as an oxygen carrier via sulphur retention. The operation is similar to what happens in a circulating fluidized bed boiler burning coal. In the present research work, the study of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations together with mass and enthalpy balances have been carried out for a CLC system in order to investigate whether the LCL-C (TM) process is a promising and energy efficient option to carry out the coal combustion with CO2 capture and in-situ desulphurisation. So, no limitations were found to transfer the required oxygen from air to fuel using sulphated limestone as oxygen carrier for whatever coal used. The selection of a suitable oxygen carrier to fuel ratio mainly depends on the sulphur content of the coal used. In addition, no drawback referred to thermal integration in the system has been detected. Thus, operation at 950 degrees C in the fuel reactor to avoid SO2 release via side reactions, and 1050 degrees C in the air reactor is feasible. Likewise, experimental tests have been performed in a thermogravimetric analyser to evaluate the capability of a limestone to be sulphated and to transfer oxygen. A value of the oxygen transport capacity of about 16.7 wt.% was obtained. This value is four times higher than that of others typical inexpensive oxygen carriers published in literature.

Results show that the combination of ozonation, ultraviolet (UV), and electro-generation of H2O2 could lead to significant synergistic effects that enhanced the pseudo-first order rate constant for 1,4-dioxane degradation to 33 times that of the simple linear addition of the three single processes. In addition, the PEP process could mineralize total organic carbon (TOC) from 1,4-dioxane solutions much faster than the three single processes, as well as their binary combinations (UV/O-3 and the electro-peroxone (EP) process). After 45 min of treatment, the UV/O-3, EP, and PEP processes removed similar to 70%, 37%, and 98% TOC with a specific energy consumption (SEC) of similar to 0.38, 0.22, and 0.30 kW h/g TOCremoved, respectively. Increasing ozone (03) dose, applied current, and solution pH increased generally the rate of TOC removal during the PEP process. When sodium chloride (NaCl) was used as the supporting electrolyte, chlorine (Cl-2) and hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO-, formed from anodic oxidation of Cl-) would react with H2O2, thus diminishing its synergistic effects with O-3 and UV for pollutant degradation. Consequently, TOC removal was much less efficient when the PEP process was conducted in NaCl electrolytes than in sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolytes, especially when using anodes (ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium, RuO2-IrO2/Ti) with higher chlorine evolution activity.

Sufficient cracking of the C21+ fraction was achieved under FTS conditions and primary cracking was proven as dominant. Higher temperature has a positive effect on HC, but too high temperature would turn out to increase the C1-4 selectivity and a maximum of 70 wt.% C-5-C-20 was obtained. The cracking of FTS hydrocarbons could be divided into two categories, cracking of heavy molecules via liquid phase and cracking of light molecules depending on gas phase. The cracking of lights was slightly suppressed when raising the H-2 partial pressure, while the cracking of heavy molecules showed no response. Differently, an increase of the CO partial pressure obviously inhibited the cracking performance of both fractions. The wax flow rate study revealed a quite selective cracking of FTS wax, since the cracking of light hydrocarbons is partial pressure-limited.

For perforation, four studies (Level II-2, fair to poor) found very low perforation rates (range; 0%-0.1%), with no significant differences between younger and older women. Pregnancies were generally rare among young IUD users in nine studies (Level I to II-2, fair to poor), and no differences were reported for young IUD users compared with young combined oral contraceptive (COC) or etonogestrel (ENG) implant users. PID was rare-among young IUD users; one study reported no cases among COC or IUD users, and one reported no difference in PlD among LNG-IUD users compared with ENG implant users from nationwide insurance claims data (Level I to II-2, fair). One study reported decreased odds of bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with COC use among young women, while one study of young women reported decreased odds of removal for bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with ENG implant (Level I to II-2, fair). Conclusion: Overall evidence suggests that the risk of adverse outcomes related to pregnancy, perforation, infection, heavy bleeding or removals for bleeding among young IUD users is low and may not be clinically meaningful. However, the risk of expulsion, especially for Cu-IUDs, is higher for younger women compared with older women. If IUD expulsion occurs, a young woman is exposed to an increased risk of unintended pregnancy if replacement contraception is not initiated. IUDs are safe for young women and provide highly effective reversible contraception. Published by Elsevier Inc.",2022,95,23,EF1KB,2020/6/1

Long-acting reversible contraception, such as intrauterine contraception (IUC), is effective in reducing unintended pregnancy. Objective: This study aims to review access to, uptake of and influencing factors on IUC use in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: We searched PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between 1990 and 2015. We identified and reviewed primary studies that examined the following points and were relevant to the Asia-Pacific region: available types and utilization rates of IUC and factors that influence these. We also obtained the opinions of local experts to gain a better understanding of the situation in specific countries. Results: Types of IUC used and utilization rates vary widely across the region. Factors influencing rates of utilization relate to healthcare systems, such as government policy on and subsidization of IUC, types of healthcare providers authorized to place IUC and local guidelines on preinsertion screening. Healthcare provider factors include concerns around pelvic inflammatory disease and the suitability of IUC in certain groups of women, whereas end-user factors include lack of awareness of IUC, concerns about safety, cultural or religious attitudes, access to IUC and costs. Conclusions: Across the Asia-Pacific region, clear data gaps and unmet needs exist in terms of access to and uptake of IUC. We believe that several recommendations are necessary to update future practice and policy for enhanced IUC utilization so that women across this region have better access to IUC.

Methods: The study reviewed data from 6873 women in four WHO-HRP randomized trials on EC conducted between 1993 and 2010. Participants took either 1.5 mg of LNG as a single dose or in two doses 12 h apart, up to 120 h of unprotected intercourse. Contraceptive efficacy (pregnancy rates) at different weight and BMI categories was evaluated. Results: Overall pregnancy rate was low at 1.2%. Pregnancy rates were also low in women weighing over 80 kg (0.7%) and who were obese (BMI over 30 kg/m(2)) (2.0%). The pooled analyses for pregnancy demonstrated that BMI over 30 kg/m2 decreased efficacy significantly (odds ratio 8.27, 95% confidence interval = 2.70-25.37) when compared to women in lower BMI categories, mainly influenced by pregnancies in obese women from one study site. Sensitivity analyses excluding that site showed that obesity was no longer a risk factor; however, the other studies included too few obese women in the sample to exclude a substantial decrease in efficacy. Conclusions: Pregnancy rates with use of LNG 1.5 mg for EC were low at less than 3% across different weight and BMI categories. Pooled analyses showed an increase in pregnancy rates among obese women (BMI more than 30 kg/m(2)) compared to women with normal BMI levels, influenced by pregnancies all coming from one study site.

The objective of this study was to examine the role of weight and weight perception on contraceptive use. Study design: Using cross-sectional data from the MyNewOptions study, we analyzed contraceptive use among 987 privately insured, sexually active women aged 18-40 years. Contraception was categorized into three groups: (1) long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), (2) non-LARC prescription methods and (3) nonprescription methods/no method. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model the effect of body mass index category and weight perception on contraceptive use while controlling for pregnancy intentions, sexual behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Eighty-three (8.4%) women were using LARCs, 490 (49.6%) women were using non-LARC prescription methods and 414 (42.0%) were using nonprescription methods or no method. In the adjusted multinomial model, overweight [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85-7.98) and obese women (aOR 2.82, 95% CI 1.18-6.72) were significantly more likely to use LARCs compared to normal-weight women. There were greater adjusted odds of overweight and obese women using nonprescription methods/no method compared with non-LARC prescription methods, but this finding did not reach statistical significance. Weight perception was not associated with contraceptive use. Conclusion: In this study sample, overweight and obese women were more likely to use LARCs than normal-weight women. It will be important to further understand how weight influences women and providers' views on contraception in order to better assist women with individualized, patient-centered contraceptive decision making.

Study design: This prospective study of feasibility and patient acceptability recruited women interested in a postpartum LNG IUS and placed the LNG IUS under ultrasound guidance on days 14-20 postpartum. We determined feasibility by our ability to recruit and insert the LNG IUS in our predetermined sample size of 50 women. We measured our primary acceptability outcome at 6 months postpartum with the question: ""Would you recommend Mirena placement at 2 weeks postpartum to a friend?"" Other outcomes included expulsion and pain. The three study visits consisted of (1) insertion visit (14-20 days postpartum), (2) standard postpartum visit with a string check (6 weeks postpartum) and (3) research visit with sonography and assessment of the primary outcome (6 months postpartum). Results: We enrolled 50 women over 8 months, all of whom received LNG IUS. Forty-three of the 50 (86%) provided follow-up data for the primary outcome. Of those, 93% (40/43) would recommend 2-week LNG IUS insertion to a friend, and 86% (37/43) continued using their LNG IUS at the conclusion of the 6-month visit. There were two partial expulsions; one was symptomatic. There were no uterine perforations. Conclusions: LNG IUS inserted at 2 weeks postpartum is feasible and acceptable to patients.

Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among Medicaid-enrolled women using medical record review for all women receiving the etonogestrel implant between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2014. We compared the percentage of women with the implant removed at 6 and 12 months as well as reasons for early removal, for inpatient postpartum implant insertions vs. delayed postpartum or interval outpatient implant insertions. Results: A total of 4% of women (34/776 insertions) had documented implant removal within 6 months post-insertion, with no difference between postpartum inpatient and outpatient (delayed postpartum or interval). A total of 12% (62/518 insertions) of women had documented implant removal within 12 months. A lower percentage of women with postpartum inpatient insertions had the implant removed at 12 months post-insertion, compared to outpatient insertions (7% vs. 14%, p=.04). After controlling for age, parity, race and body mass index, women with postpartum inpatient insertions were less likely to have the implant removed within 12 months (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.97). The most commonly stated reason for removal was abnormal uterine bleeding, regardless of insertion timing.

Prior research has examined the cost-effectiveness of contraception in general; however, no studies have developed a formal decision model in the context of the new ACA provisions. As such, this study aims to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of insurance coverage of contraception under employer-sponsored insurance coverage taking into consideration newer regulations allowing for religious exemptions. Study design: A decision model was developed from the employer perspective to simulate pregnancy costs and outcomes associated with insurance coverage. Method-specific estimates of contraception failure rates, outcomes and costs were derived from the literature. Uptake by marital status and age was drawn from a nationally representative database. Results: Providing no contraception coverage resulted in 33 more unintended pregnancies per 1000 women (95% confidence range: 22.4; 44.0). This subsequently significantly increased the number of unintended births and terminations. Total costs were higher among uninsured women owing to higher costs of pregnancy outcomes. The effect of no insurance was greatest on unmarried women 20-29 years old. Conclusions: Denying female employees' full coverage of contraceptives increases total costs from the employer perspective, as well as the total number of terminations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study estimates the effect of m4RH, an mHealth service in Kenya that provides family planning information via text message, on consumers' knowledge and use of contraception. Study design: We randomly assigned new consumers of the m4RH service to receive either full access or limited access to m4RH. We collected data on outcomes by sending questions directly to consumers via text message. Results: Response rates to the text message surveys ranged from 51.8% to 13.5%. Despite relatively low response rates, response rates were very similar across the full-access and limited-access groups. We fmd that full access to m4RH increased consumers' scores on a test of contraceptive knowledge by 14% (95% confidence interval: 9.9%-18.2%) compared to a control group with limited access to m4RH. m4RH did not increase consumers' use of contraception, likelihood of discussing family planning with their partners, or likelihood of visiting a clinic to discuss family planning.

We conducted a content analysis of 116 TV news segments covering contraception during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Segments were quantitatively coded for contraceptive methods covered, story sources used, and inclusion of medical and nonmedical content (intercoder reliability using Krippendorf s alpha ranged 0.6-1 for coded categories). Results: Most (55%) news stories focused on contraception in general rather than specific methods. The most effective contraceptive methods were rarely discussed (implant, 1%; intrauterine device, 4%). The most frequently used sources were political figures (40%), advocates (25%), the general public (25%) and Catholic Church leaders (16%); medical professionals (11%) and health researchers (4%) appeared in a minority of stories. A minority of stories (31%) featured medical content. Conclusions: National network news coverage of contraception frequently focuses on contraception in political and social terms and uses nonmedical figures such as politicians and church leaders as sources. This focus deemphasizes the public health aspect of contraception, leading medical professionals and health content to be rarely featured. Published by Elsevier Inc.",2022,95,7,EF1KB,2020/6/10

Abortion legislation, maternal healthcare, fertility, female literacy, sanitation, violence against women and maternal deaths: a natural experiment in 32 Mexican states. BMJ Open 2015;5(2):e006013] claimed that Mexican states with more restrictive abortion laws had lower levels of maternal mortality. Our objectives are to replicate the analysis, reanalyze the data and offer a critique of the key flaws of the Koch study. Study design: We used corrected maternal mortality data (2006-2013), live births, and state-level indicators of poverty. We replicate the published analysis. We then reclassified state-level exposure to abortion on demand based on actual availability of abortion (Mexico City versus the other 31 states) and test the association of abortion access and the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) using descriptives over time, pooled chi-square tests and regression models. We included 256 state-year observations. Results: We did not find significant differences in MMR between Mexico City (MMR=49.1) and the 31 states (MMR' 44.6; p=.44). Using Koch's classification of states, we replicated published differences of higher MMR where abortion is more available. We found a significant, negative association between MMR and availability of abortion in the same multivariable models as Koch, but using our state classification (beta=-22.49, 95% CI=-38.9; 5.99). State-level poverty remains highly correlated with MMR. Conclusion: Koch makes errors in methodology and interpretation, making false causal claims about abortion law and MMR. MMR is falling most rapidly in Mexico City, but our main study limitation is an inability to draw causal inference about abortion law or access and maternal mortality. We need rigorous evidence about the health impacts of increasing access to safe abortion worldwide. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The northern Australian tropical region is a particularly challenging environment for human physical activity and regional development projects. Increases in temperature and rainfall will exacerbate these challenges. Knowledge of past climatic trends and their impacts provides important information for prudent development planning. This paper quantifies the observed changes in temperature and rainfall across northern Australia for the period 1911-2013, based on Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) temperature and rainfall data for 4 coastal and 3 inland locations across the region. We compared two 30 yr periods, 1911-1940 and 1984-2013, to the baseline period 1961-1990 averages and SD values. Trends were identified in decadal monthly temperatures, maximum temperatures > 30 degrees C and minimum temperatures > 21 degrees C, shifts in the daily maximum and minimum temperature frequency distribution curves and changes in seasonal rainfall above and below the +/- 1 SD values. The results indicate this tropical region is now warmer and wetter compared to the 1911-1940 period with an increase in the number of days > 30 and > 33 degrees C. Coastal warming was more pronounced than at inland locations and shows seasonal variations; whilst western and central inland areas have become wetter, little trend change was apparent in the eastern rainfall. With projections of further warming, development plans for the region need to incorporate the associated deleterious impacts on human activity.

Longer-term ecosystem dynamics, including the extent to which this regime shift was exceptional in the context of the past century, remain poorly described due to a lack of multi-decadal biological time series. To explore the impact of decadal regime shifts on higher trophic levels, we applied dendrochronology (tree-ring science) techniques to the otolith growth-increment widths of Pacific ocean perch Sebastes alutus (POP) collected from the continental slope of the eastern Bering Sea. After crossdating, 2 chronology development techniques were applied: (1) a regional curve standardization (RCS) approach designed to retain as much low-frequency variability as possible, and (2) an individual-detrending approach that maximized interannual synchrony among samples. Both chronologies spanned the years 1919-2006 and were significantly (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with sea surface temperature (March-December). The RCS chronology showed a transition from relatively slow to fast growth after 1976-1977. In both chronologies, the highest observed growth values immediately followed the regime shift, suggesting that this event had a critical and lasting impact on growth of POP. This growth pulse was, however, not shared by a previously published yellowfin sole Limanda aspera chronology (1969-2006) from the eastern Bering Sea shelf, indicating species- or site-specific responses.

It is critical to quantify the interaction between climate warming and crop management on sugarcane phenology to understand the adaptation of crop to climate change. Similarly, in crop modeling, parameterizing the phenology of new crop varieties is a major challenge. Historical changes between 1980 and 2014 in spring and autumn sugarcane phenology have been observed in Punjab, Pakistan. Planting, emergence, stalk elongation, peak population and harvest dates advanced by a mean of 2.87, 2.63, 4.47, 5.01 and 6.41 d decade(-1), respectively for spring sugarcane, and were delayed by 6.59, 6.21, 4.38, 3.13 and 2.17 d decade(-1), respectively for autumn sugarcane.

The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of T-leaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict T-leaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20-35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. T-leaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that T-leaf is best explained by air temperature (T-air) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in T-leaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteoro logical data are available.

In 84% (16) of recurrences, the cause of recurrence was relapse with prior strain of C difficile. In 16% (3) of recurrent episodes, reinfection with a new strain of C difficile was the cause. In conclusion, the majority of CDI recurrences at our institution were due to infection with the same strain rather than infection with a new strain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These set of extracted DNA samples had already tested positive for Pneumocystis and patients had been classified in probable and unlikely PCP in a previous study. To evaluate de accuracy of the DHPS mutant's identification, an ""in house"" PCR and sequencing was performed. The sensitivity and specificity of PneumoGenius (R) PCR in discriminating between probable and unlikely Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) were 70% and 82% respectively. PneumoGenius (R) PCR was able to genotype more samples than ""in house"" DHPS PCR and sequencing.

However, the mechanisms of resistance to this compound have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms of resistance to this antimicrobial in two A. baumannii clinical isolates, respectively, susceptible (A027) and resistant (A009) to polymyxin B before and after polymyxin B exposure (A027(ind) and A009(ind)). The pmrAB and 1pxACD were sequenced and their transcriptional levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The bacterial cell morphology was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and the membrane potential was measured using Zeta-potential analyzer. The virulence of strains was studied using a Caenorhabditis elegans model. Both clinical isolates exhibited an elevation of the polymyxin B MIC after exposure to this compound. On the other hand, A027(ind) showed decreased values of MIC for f3-lactams, amino glycosides, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin and erythromycin. A027(ind) harbored two mutations in pmrB and the ISAba125 disrupting the 1pxA. In contrast, A009(ind) strain exhibited increase of pmrB transcriptional level, after polymyxin B exposure, despite the absence of mutations in the pmrAB genes. The TEM images revealed a thicker and more electron-dense peptidoglycan layer for A009 than that of A027. The exposure to polymyxin B induced a strong condensation and darkening of intracellular material, mainly in A009(ind). In addition, the surface charge of A009 was significantly less negative than the one of A027. Using the C elegans model, only A027(ind) strain showed a reduction on virulence. The diversity of polymyxin B resistance mechanisms among A. baumannii strains evaluated in this study confirms the complexity of these mechanisms, which may vary depending of the background of each strain.

In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics of ESBL among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing lAls and their pattern of antimicrobial resistance, which can provide useful information about the epidemiology and risk factors associated with these infections. Materials and methods: One hundred sixty-seven E.co li and 47 K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strains causing IAIs were collected from 9 hospitals in China, during 2012 and 2013. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of these strains was determined. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to identify genes for beta-lactamase (bIaTEM, b1aSHV, blaOXA-1-like, and blaCTX-M). The isolates were also analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In 167 ESBL-producing E. coli strains, 104 strains (623%) were positive for CTX-M, and 9 strains (5.39%) were positive for SHV. Among the 47 K. pneumoniae strains, 35 strains (74.5%) were positive for SHV-2a, 12 strains (25.5%) were positive for CTX-M. No TEM-type and OXA-1-like strain was detected among all the ESBL-producing strains. Regarding the CTX-M-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, CFX-M-15 was the most common genotype in E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, accounting for 28.7% and 17.0%, respectively, followed by CTX-M-55 accounting for 16.2% and 2.13%, respectively; the remaining genotypes included CTX-M-123 and CTX-M-82. PFGE showed that E.coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strains causing lAls were diverse and that emerging resistance may not be due to the dissemination of national clones. Conclusion: The present study revealed that in ESBL-producing strains causing IAIs in China, the most common genotype for E.coli was CTX-M-15 and for K. pneumoniae was SHV-2a. However, there was a wide diversity of strains causing 'Ms among the ESBL-producing E. coll. and K. pneumoniae. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,87,4,EF2VG,2020/6/27

The galvanic corrosion of a high voltage conductor assembly consisting of a cylindrical CFRP rod surrounded by tightly wound aluminum wires has been investigated through experimental work and modeling. The main corrosion product is Al(OH)(3), which presents as a gelatinous substance in the crevices between the Al wires. The formation of Al(OH)(3) was observed to coincide with the decay in the galvanic corrosion current. A new analytical model was developed to investigate if the decay could be caused by corrosion products restricting the transport of oxygen to the cathode. Modeling of the oxygen diffusion through the deposited corrosion products generated galvanic corrosion rates that agreed well with the experimental measurements after an early exponential decay period. The findings suggest that the corrosion product deposition may be the most important galvanic corrosion rate controlling mechanism in this geometry and similar geometries.

In addition, a survey of several novel approaches to targeting inflammatory pathways currently in pre-clinical and clinical phases of development is presented. These agents primarily act to modulate microglial functioning, enhance amyloid-beta phagocytosis, suppress potentially harmful proinflammatory responses, or enhance systemic immunity. Expert commentary: While long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced incidence of AD in epidemiologic studies, randomized controlled trials have not replicated these findings. Thus, NSAID use cannot currently be recommended either for primary prevention or treatment of AD.

Objective: To develop a predictive equation from anthropometric variables (skinfolds) for estimating BF% in adolescents with DS. Methods: Twenty-three adolescents with DS (7 girls, 16 boys) participated in the study; seven skinfold measurements were taken (biceps, triceps, subscapular, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh, and medial calf), circumferences and diameters were measured following ISAK recommendations. Total body volume (and then body density) was measured with air displacement plethysmography (ADP); BF% was then calculated. Correlation between anthropometry data and BF% by ADP, and stepwise regression analyses were applied to develop a specific prediction equation. Results: All the skinfolds, BMI, hip, waist and thigh circumferences correlated with BF% and were included in the regression analysis; sex and triceps were added into the model (R-2 = 0.89, p < 0.05). Therefore the proposed equation computed as follows: BF % = (0.97 TR) - (8.869.SEX) + 15.6 where TR is triceps skinfolds (mm) and SEX is equal to 0 for female and 1 for male. Conclusions: The proposed prediction equation is recommended for the assessment of BF% in adolescents with DS as it is the only one specifically developed and validated in this unique population. It is a cheap, reliable and accessible method that removes the need for use of expensive equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,10,5,EF4KB,2020/8/11

Objective: This study aimed at analyzing the reliability and convergent validity of the 6-min run test when performed by young adults with Down syndrome (DS). Methods: In a cross-sectional design fifty-one young adults with DS (mean age 26.20 +/- 7.14 years; 54% women) performed the 6-min run test and the 16-min shuttle run test twice with a one week-interval between test and retest. Results: The 6-min run test offered high reliability for the distances covered (ICC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.955-0.985) and good reliability when comparing peak heart rate values obtained in the test and retest (ICC: 0.870; 95% CI: 0.772-0.926). A significant correlation between the 6-min run test and the 16-min shuttle run test was observed for the test (r = 0.705; Sig = 0.001), and retest phases (r = 0.651; Sig = 0.001). The relationship between the estimated maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) peak after the performance of the 16-min shuttle run test and the distance covered by the 6-min run test was statistically significant (r > 0.7). No significant differences were found between the equations that estimate VO2 peak for both tests. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the 6-min run test shows high test/retest reliability and moderate to moderately high convergent validity when performed by adults with DS.

Objectives/hypothesis: We utilized photovoice to understand how individuals define function, facilitators and bathers to function, and adaptations to support functioning. Methods: Veterans with SCI were provided with cameras and guidelines to take photographs of things that: (1) help with functioning, (2) are bathers to function, and (3) represent adaptations used to support functioning. Interviews to discuss photographs followed and were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using grounded-thematic coding. Nvivo 8 was used to store and organize data. Results: Participants (n = 9) were male (89%), Caucasian (67%), had paraplegia (75%), averaged 64 years of age, and were injured, on average, for 22 years. Function was described in several ways: the concept of 'normalcy,' aspects of daily living, and ability to be independent. Facilitators included: helpful tools, physical therapy/therapists, transportation, and caregivers. Barriers included: wheelchair-related issues and interior/exterior bathers both in the community and in the hospital. Examples of adaptations included: traditional examples like ramps, and also creative examples like the use of rubber bands on a can to help with grip. Conclusion(s): Patient-perspectives elicited in-depth information that expanded the common definition of function by highlighting the concept of ""normality,"" facilitators and bathers to function, and adaptations to optimize function. These insights emphasize function within a patient-context, emphasizing a holistic definition of function that can be used to develop personalized, patient-driven care plans.

The relationship between HCQ or MMF blood concentrations and their adverse effects requires further elucidation. The serum trough level of tacrolimus does not appear to correlate with clinical response in lupus nephritis but is associated with toxic effects. Owing to the paucity of data, the optimal' blood levels of these agents in SLE have yet to be determined by large population pharmacokinetic studies.

Secondary bladder neoplasms need to be recognized as this impacts patient management. We report our experience on nonurothelial malignancies (NUM) detected in urine cytology over a 10-year period. MethodsA 10-year retrospective search for patients with biopsy-proven NUM to the urothelial tract yielded 25 urine samples from 14 patients. Two cytopathologists blinded to the original cytology diagnosis reviewed the cytology and histology slides. The incidence, cytomorphologic features, diagnostic accuracy, factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy, and clinical impact of the cytology result were studied. ResultsThe incidence of NUM was <1%. The male:female ratio was 1.3. An abnormality was detected in 60% of the cases; however, in only 4% of the cases, a primary site was identified accurately. Of the false negatives, 96% was deemed as sampling errors and 4% was interpretational. Patient management was not impacted in any of the false-negative cases due to concurrent or past tissue diagnosis. ConclusionColon cancer was the most frequent secondary tumor. Sampling error attributed to the false-negative results. Necrosis and dirty background was often associated with metastatic lesions from colon. Obtaining history of a primary tumor elsewhere was a key factor in diagnosis of a metastatic lesion. Hematopoietic malignancies remain to be a diagnostic challenge.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy; however, other types may also be encountered. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of gallbladder malignancies diagnosed on FNAC in the last 5 years to document the cytomorphological spectrum and the variations thereof. MethodsThe records of the Department of Cytology, PGIMER were searched from July 2010 to June 2015 and all cases of gallbladder malignancies were analyzed in detail for cytomorphological characteristics. Giemsa and Hematoxylin-Eosin stained slides were evaluated with immunocytochemistry on cell blocks wherever available. ResultsA total of 791 gallbladder FNAC performed in cases of radiologically suspected gallbladder malignancies were evaluated. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) was more common in females with a male to female ratio of 1:2.3. Median age was 53.4 years (range 24-85 years); 81 cases (10.2%) were nondiagnostic and 31 (3.9%) were suspicious of malignancy. A total of 645 FNACs were positive for malignancy, out of which there were 619 (96%) adenocarcinoma and 26 cases with unusual malignancies.

It frequently involves lymph nodes and extranodal sites and is associated with favorable prognosis. A 20-year old man was admitted for painful mass in the left axilla with overlying skin redness. Clinical presentation and US findings were highly suspicious for sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis was established cytolologically and using ancillary technologies from cytological samples. Fine needle aspiration cytology of tumor mass (lymph node conglomerate and surrounding tissue) show predominance of large, pleomorphic, atypical cells with large nuclei and vacuolised cytoplasm. Atypical cells immunocytochemically were positive for LCA, CD30, CD3, EMA, and ALK; negative for CD15 and CD56. NPM-ALK transcript was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT). Molecular analysis of TCR ss and TCR genes demonstrated clonal TCR genes rearrangement. Complex karyotype with multiple numerical and structural changes was found on conventional cytogenetics. These findings excluded sarcoma and corroborated the diagnosis of ALK positive ALCL. Cutaneous involvement in ALCL can clinically mimic sarcoma, especially in cases with localized disease without B symptoms. In those cases, immunostaining, PCR, and conventional cytogenetics are helpful to exclude sarcoma. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:51-54. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2022,45,4,EF4DE,2020/9/8

The patient was a 54-year-old female whose chief complaint was intermittent severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed-tomography (CT) imaging revealed a mass between the head and the body of the pancreas. EUS-FNA smear preparation was obtained but was nondiagnostic. However, examination of the tissue cell block showed sheets of epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and immunohistochemistry studies revealed positivity for both melanocytic (HMB-45 and Melan-A) and smooth muscle markers (actin and desmin). A diagnosis of PEComa was made and an uncomplicated middle pancreatectomy was performed. Our case and review of the literature demonstrates that EUS-FNA complemented with tissue cell block increases cellular yield, improved preoperative diagnostic accuracy, and may assist the surgeon in planning conservative surgical management.

Individuals with ID may find nutritional guidelines difficult to follow and many face personal and environmental barriers for physical activity. Bariatric surgery may reduce obesity related health comorbidities while promoting sustained weight loss in diverse populations. Yet no study has reviewed the feasibility of conducting bariatric surgery on individuals with ID. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review of literature on bariatric procedures performed on individuals with D. Methods: Authors searched electronic database via PubMED, Science Direct, Wiley and Medline (1975-2014). Extracted articles were evaluated independently following scoping reviews guidelines. Results: Reviewers included sixteen studies. Nine surgical interventions were reported on 49 patients with ID. Studies followed either case report or case series design. The most common procedure patients received was biliopancreatic diversion (n = 24) followed by Roux en -Y Gastric Bypass (n = 12). Degree of weight loss was the primary outcome in each study. Excess weight loss (%EWL) ranged from 12% to 86%. Further benefits included improved quality of life, decreased psychological tension within family and resolution of sleep apnea, hypertension, respiratory distress and type II diabetes. Six studies included a post-operative follow-up period below two years. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery may be a viable option to treat obesity in individuals with ID but there is no consensus which procedure is preferred and which associated interventions should be in place to warrant long lasting results.

We compared effectiveness of online cancer genetics information presented using a bilingual approach (ASL with English closed captioning) and a monolingual approach (English text). Hypothesis: Bilingual modality would increase cancer genetics knowledge and confidence to create a family tree; education would interact with modality. Methods: We used a parallel 2:1 randomized pre-post study design stratified on education. 150 Deaf ASL-users years old with computer and internet access participated online; 100 (70 high, 30 low education) and 50 (35 high, 15 low education) were randomized to the bilingual and monolingual modalities. Modalities provide virtually identical content on creating a family tree, using the family tree to identify inherited cancer risk factors, understanding how cancer predisposition can be inherited, and the role of genetic counseling and testing for prevention or treatment. 25 true/false items assessed knowledge; a Likert scale item assessed confidence. Data were collected within 2 weeks before and after viewing the information. Results: Significant interaction of language modality, education, and change in knowledge scores was observed (p = .01). High education group increased knowledge regardless of modality (Bilingual: p < .001; d = .56; Monolingual: p < .001; d = 1.08). Low education group increased knowledge with bilingual (p < .001; d = .85), but not monolingual (p = .79; d = .08) modality. Bilingual modality yielded greater confidence creating a family tree (p = .03). Conclusions: Bilingual approach provides a better opportunity for lower educated Deaf ASL-users to access cancer genetics information than a monolingual approach. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Objective: The main purpose of this study was to examine the criterion validity of the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-S) in Deaf adults. Method: This study included 44 adults (18-65 years) of both genders (63.6% were females) who met the inclusion criteria. Objective measures of PA were collected using accelerometers, which were worn by each participant during one week. After using the accelerometer, the IPAQ-S was applied to assess participants' physical activity during the last 7 days. Results: There was no significant correlation between the average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as measured by the accelerometer (40.1 +/- 24.5 min/day) and by the IPAQ-S (41.3 +/- 57.5 min/day). The IPAQ-S significantly underestimated the time spent in sedentary behavior (7.6 +/- 2.7 h/day vs. 10.1 +/- 1.6 h/day). Sedentary behavior and MVPA as measured by the accelerometer and the IPAQ-S showed limited agreement. Conclusions: Our results show some limitations on the use of IPAQ-S for quantifying PA among adults who are Deaf. The IPAQ-S tends to overestimate the MVPA and to underestimate sedentary behavior in adults who are Deaf. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,10,6,EF4KB,2018/7/2

Objective: The main objective was to determine whether subgroups of people with disabilities are more likely than people without disabilities to delay/forgo necessary care, in general and among the insured. Methods: We used pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2004-2010) to examine delaying or forgoing medical, dental, and pharmacy care among five disability subgroups (physical, cognitive, visual, hearing, multiple) and the non-disabled population. Logistic regression was conducted to examine delayed/forgone care, controlling for sociodemographic, health, and health care factors. Results: Over 13% of all working-age adults delayed/forwent necessary care; lack of insurance was the strongest predictor of unmet needs. Among the insured, disability subgroups were greater than two times more likely to report delayed/forgone care than adults without disabilities. Insured working-age adults with multiple chronic conditions and those with ADL/IADL assistance needs had higher odds of delayed or forgone care than their peers without these characteristics. Reasons related to affordability were most often listed as leading to unmet needs, regardless of disability. Conclusion: Although insurance status most strongly predicted unmet needs for care, many people with insurance delayed/forewent necessary care. Even among the insured, all disability subgroups had significantly greater likelihood of having to delay/forgo care than those without disabilities. Differences also existed between the disability subgroups. Cost was most frequently cited reason for unmet needs. Published by Elsevier Inc.",2022,10,9,EF4KB,2018/7/3

Findings regarding service use among persons with disabilities supports the notion of disparities but provides inconsistent evidence of underuse of recommended care. Objective: To examine the extent to which receipt of recommended care among older Medicare beneficiaries varies by disability status, using a newly developed staging method to classify individuals according to disability. Methods: In a cohort study, we included community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who participated in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey between 2001 and 2008. Logistic regression modeling assessed the association of receiving recommended care on 38 indicators across different activity limitation stages. Results: Nearly one out of every three elderly Medicare beneficiaries did not receive overall recommended care. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) revealed a decrease in use of recommended care with increasing activity limitation stage. For instance, ORs (95% CIs) across mild, moderate, severe and complete limitation stages (stages I-IV) compared to no limitation (stage 0) in ADLs were 0.99 (0.94-1.05), 0.89 (0.83-0.95), 0.81 (0.75-0.89) and 0.56 (0.46-0.68).

Methods: 2007-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Full-Year Consolidated files, medical conditions files, and the 1996-2012 pooled linkage files were merged for this analysis. This analysis focused on five selected conditions that are associated with disability: Visual impairment and blindness, spinal cord injury, intellectual disability, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. Unadjusted and adjusted rates of receipt estimated using various multivariable regression techniques. Results: The proportion with diabetes was higher among those with a selected condition (12.1%) than without (7.1%).

Most measures of the environment use subjective ratings, yet little is known about how people appraise the environment. Objective: Hypothesis: We conducted this post-hoc study to examine whether or not catastrophizing, an important variable for understanding how pain contributes to disability, may be related to ratings of the environment. We hypothesized higher pain catastrophizing scores would be associated with greater environmental barriers and fewer facilitators. Methods: Individuals with functional impairments (N = 525) were recruited from a population-based random sample of households in a small western city in the United States to complete a paper-based survey about their health and community living experiences. We conducted exploratory regression analyses to investigate associations with environmental factor ratings. Results: We found substantial associations between pain catastrophizing and both environmental barriers and personal factor problems after controlling for demographics, participation assessed by community trips per week, health conditions, impairment and pain level. The models accounted for 28% of the variance in environmental factor ratings and 52% of the variability personal factor ratings. We also present odds ratios for the association between personal characteristics and the likelihood of endorsing EF and PF. Conclusions: A variety of individual characteristics are associated with ratings of both environmental and personal factors that impact participation. Among these, pain catastrophizing is a robust predictor of EF and PF ratings which suggests future research designed specifically to test this relationship may generate useful results for developing interventions to increase participation.

Health care, education, employment, independent living, and community engagement have been identified as areas of concern. However, relatively little research has been done to understand the experiences, perceptions, and needs of individuals with cerebral palsy as they transition toward adulthood. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the transition experiences, perceptions, and needs of young adults with cerebral palsy living in one state in the southeastern United States. Methods: Focus groups with nine young adults with cerebral palsy (19-34 years) were conducted. The focus group interview explored the preparation for transition and experiences navigating adulthood. The audio-recorded groups were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Young adults with cerebral palsy identified numerous challenges associated with navigating adulthood. The main themes were: 1) being thrust into adulthood; 2) navigating systems and services; 3) understanding and managing my body; and 4) dealing with stereotypes and prejudice. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to transition with a focus on building capacity and empowerment. To navigate complex systems of care, ""navigators"" or ""facilitators"" are needed. Additionally, practitioners and service providers in adult systems need further education about cerebral palsy.

Objective: To directly compare results for survey respondents with SCD with those for proxies provided for non-respondents with SCD. Methods: Publicly available 2011 BRFSS data from 120,485 households in 21 states were analyzed using Stata. Respondents ages 40 and older with SCD (n = 10,831) were compared with proxy responses for non-respondents ages 40 and older with SCD (n = 4296) living in households where the respondent did not have SCD. Outcome measures included functional difficulties associated with their SCD, needing help, receiving informal care, talking with a healthcare provider about their SCD, getting treatment, and having a dementia diagnosis. Logistic regression for each outcome controlled for age, household income, state of residence, and number of household adults. Results: Non-respondents were significantly more likely than respondents by Pearson chi square tests with alpha = 0.05 to report all 6 outcomes. Adjusted odds ratios comparing non-respondents with respondents ranged from 2.61 (95% confidence interval: 2.22-3.07) for needing help, to 8.99 (6.60-12.24) for a dementia diagnosis and confirmed unadjusted results. Conclusion: Respondent results only represent adults capable of answering a telephone survey. To represent all household adults and avoid nonresponse bias that may under-represent the true population parameters by as much as 70%, results must include both respondents and non-respondents. Other measures may be similarly affected if they inhibit one's ability to respond to a telephone survey (e.g. disability, stroke). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: Examine the usability, feasibility, and effectiveness of adapting an existing evidence-based weight loss program for people with IM. Methods: In this single-group pre-test post-test pilot study, 10 overweight or obese individuals with permanent IM (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, osteoarthritis) participated in a 20-week modification of the DPP Group Lifestyle BalanceTM (DPP GLB) program, a group-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Fifteen conference calls encouraged reducing calorie and fat intake and increasing exercise through self-monitoring and problem solving. We defined feasibility as retention and engagement, usability as participants' program satisfaction ratings, and effectiveness as physiological and psychosocial change measured on three occasions over 20 weeks. Analytic methods included basic descriptive statistics (feasibility and usability) and repeated measures ANOVA (effectiveness). Results: The program retained 70% of participants. These individuals attended an average of 79.3% of conference calls and self monitored more than half of the weeks. Participants rated the program highly, with mean overall scores of 6.3 +/- 0.3 and 6.2 +/- 0.6 out of 7 on helpfulness and satisfaction scales, respectively. Program completers experienced a significant mean weight loss of 8.86 +/- 8.37 kg (p = 0.024), or 7.4% of their start weight, and significantly reduced their BMI. Conclusions: An adapted version of the DPP GLB is a feasible, usable, and potentially effective intervention for promoting weight loss among persons with IM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, its prevalence among people with disabilities in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) is unknown. Objectives: The objectives were to: (1) examine the prevalence of the homebound status among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs, and (2) identify its clinical, functional, and environmental determinants. Methods: This study included 221 community-dwelling subjects, aged >= 50 years, who applied for long-term care services at the Office for Legal Certification of Long-term Care Need of Coruna (Spain). Each subject had a disability in ADLs and was interviewed by a trained examiner in the subject's home. The participants were considered homebound if they remained inside their home during the previous week. Measures: Demographic, clinical, functional, and environmental factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with homebound status. Results: The prevalence of homebound status was 39.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of architectural bathers at the home entrance (stairs [OR: 6.67, p < 0.001] or a heavy door [OR: 2.83, p = 0.023]), walking ability limitations (OR: 3.26, p = 0.006), and higher age (OR: 1.05, p = 0.04) were associated with homebound status. Conclusions: Homebound status is a highly prevalent problem among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs. Architectural factors in the home and walking ability limitations seem to be important predictors, suggesting that health care interventions should target home adaptations and mobility skills as a means to preventing or decreasing homebound status.

WOS:000390293100021,"Luck-Sikorski, C; Riedel-Heller, SG",Obesity as a disability - A representative survey of individuals with obesity from Germany,English,Article,"Background: While obesity can be an antecedent of disability and the prevalence of disabilities in increased in individuals with obesity, it has been highly debated whether obesity itself should be considered a disability. The European Court of justice has set a precedent in 2014, ruling that severe forms of obesity qualify for protection under the disability protection legislation. However, attitudes and opinions of those affected have not been investigated yet. Objective: To study attitudes of people with obesity regarding the acknowledgment of obesity as a disability. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a population-based study from Germany, conducted in 2015, in n = 1000 individuals with obesity. Results: We find that 38.2% of all respondents agreed that obesity ought to be considered a disability. In logistic regression analyses, heavier participants expressed a higher support of obesity seen as a disability, regardless of perceived discrimination experiences (Delta OR = 1.54, p = 0.427). Experiences of perceived discrimination were associated with a higher approval of obesity as a disability in individuals with class II obesity (OR = 2.07, p = 0.002) compared to respondents with less severe obesity. Conclusion: These findings go in line with the European Court of Justice's ruling, where it is stated that only severe forms of obesity qualify for protection under the disability legislation. The results underline the importance of considering adding weight to anti-discrimination legislation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,10,5,EF4KB,2018/7/3

One option for exercise alongside formal physiotherapy is local fitness facilities but accessibility is often found wanting and gyms are seen as unwelcoming to pwND. Objective: The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the perceptions of fitness facility managers with respect to exercise for pwND in a gym environment. The aim was to identify potential barriers to provision by the fitness industry for pwND. Methods: The participants included those who were in a position to influence provision at a policy level and those working at management level within fitness providers. A mixed methods approach was used: a quantitative questionnaire and 4 qualitative interviews. Descriptive and correlational analysis, thematic content analysis and concurrent triangulation analysis was undertaken. Results: Specially trained staff is perceived to be necessary to make fitness facilities accessible for pwND. Conclusions: Ensuring the provision of specially trained staff to support pwND to exercise in gyms may be the main barrier to provision for this population. Investigation into the standard training of fitness professionals combining the expertise of neurological physiotherapists with that of fitness professionals to meet the needs of pwND would be advantageous.

With recent advances in this field, a new 2-coordinate complex, which is predicted to show a blocking temperature of more than 77 K, is also introduced. The existence of a proton in the nitrogen atom of porphyrin ligands quenches the single-molecule magnet because of the destruction of the symmetry, which can be possibly overlooked because of the disorder of the position of the proton in the crystals.",2022,46,9,EF4TN,2018/7/3

The PCBOE-based devices exhibited lower power conversion efficiency and larger hysteresis than the PCBM-based device owing to the low electron mobility of PCBOEs, which causes charge accumulation at the perovskite/ECM interface. Moreover, the photovoltage of the investigated devices is identical, which indicates that the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 is predominant in determining the photovoltage in planar heterojunction PSCs.",2023,46,3,EF4TN,2018/7/3

A control Lyapunov function was used as a terminal cost to ensure stability of the model predictive control. The controller validation results show that the algorithm can be implemented in real-time with a steady-state RMS error of less than 2 degrees.

Three of typically presented in gasoline sulfur species, i.e. thiophene, 2-methylthiophene and 2,5-dimethylthiophene, were selected to investigate the different sulfur compounds removal efficiency from n-octane/sulfur species used as a model gasoline. The influence of process parameters such as feed temperature, feed concentration on OSCs removal from model n-octane/sulfur compound mixtures was also examined. During the test, the commercial hydrophobic PEBA-based and PDMS-based composite membranes were applied. Conducted experiments with chosen sulfur species confirmed that the structure of a component and the resulting differences in the affinity toward tested membrane and physico-chemical properties can influence the membrane performance and led to different separation efficiency. Total flukes for n-octane/thiophene, n-octane/2-methylthiophene and octane/2,5-dimethylhiophene mixtures at 30 degrees C were equal to be 1.33, 1.42 and 1.29 kg/m(2) h in case of PEBA membrane and 7.21, 7.48 and 7.34 kg/m(2) h for PDMS-base membrane, with the corresponding separation factor beta values of 7.04, 3.95 and 1.25 for PEBA and 2.95, 1.56 and 1.01 for PDMS, respectively. The intrinsic selectivity for tiophene/n-octane mixture (alpha(T/O)) also indicated that PEBA membrane (alpha(T/O) approximate to 18) is much more selective than PDMS one (alpha(T/O) approximate to 7.5).

Theories that allow for estimating the adhesion force, or the force to separate surfaces from contact, with simple, single-equation theories (i.e., by considering roughness asperities as submerged-spheres) can be easily instituted in discrete element method simulations of many-particle systems, but require inputs that rely on quantification of the surface roughness. In this work, Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) topographical surface maps reveal that two scales of roughness characterize the surfaces of particles examined, similar to prior studies. Previously, the separation of the two roughness scales and determination of the associated wavelength, which are necessary for predicting adhesion forces, relied on visual selection. Here, an objective methodology to separate the scales of surface roughness and calculate the wavelength of each scale is established. Two artifacts are identified when using the new methodology that negatively impact adhesion force predictions if not eliminated, namely the Gibbs artifact and an ""atomic-scale-noise"" artifact. Procedures to overcome these artifacts are developed. The resulting surface roughness characterizations are employed in a new theory, the predictions of which are in excellent agreement with AFM pull-off force measurements. The new theory extends a current van der Waals theory, which treats surface roughness as submerged spheres, by accounting for two rough surfaces instead of one.",2018,69,12,ED7SA,2020/08/28

We show that this engineering device can be implemented under mild reaction conditions (low temperature and pressure) and outside the explosive regime (low hydrogen concentration), making it appealing for industrial applications. The ceramic membrane allows for a separate feed of the reactants, therefore addressing the PO selectivity issue related to the propylene hydrogenation. The reaction is operated in a continuous methanol flow fed with propylene inside the tubular membrane; hydrogen and oxygen are fed through the porous, material. We observe that the feeding strategy of the reactants has an important effect on key parameters such as PO selectivity and productivity. By separating propylene from hydrogen, the propane formation was reduced with respect to conventional packed bed reactors. Moreover, the addition of small amounts of NaBr to the reaction medium increases the catalytic activity to PO, but also to propane formation. Therefore, this study provides a good starting point in the design of a membrane reactor device for the direct synthesis of PO where the main limitations such as propylene hydrogenation and water formation can be addressed.

Considering the targeted application for non-structural building material, the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths as well as the water absorption of the mortars were evaluated. The incorporation of POFA and polymer fibres (polypropylene and acrylic) exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction generally reduced the thermal conductivity and compressive strength as well as increased the water absorption of the mortars. Although the inclusion of POFA did not reduce the strength loss upon exposure to elevated temperature, the addition of fibres above 0.3% had slight effect in reducing the compressive strength loss. Thus, based on the optimization in terms of the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths, it is recommended to incorporate high volume POFA and addition of polymer fibres exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction for non-structural application in building materials.

First, it estimates solar cell price in Japan in the case resource allocation for R&D of crystalline silicon solar cells was not significantly reduced, but maintained almost constant level. For the projection, it does not use experience curve, but models technological progress, price reduction, of solar cell in Japan with a variable technology knowledge stock by excluding mass production effects. Second, solar cell prices in other countries are estimated based on their market share in the global solar cell production. The estimated solar cell price in Japan under the assumed resource allocation decreases by about 30% compared to the actual one and it, therefore, could be competitive to the estimated solar cell prices in China and Taiwan. In this case, Japan could maintain its top market share in the global solar cell production several years longer.

MethodsA 10-year retrospective search for patients with biopsy-proven NUM to the urothelial tract yielded 25 urine samples from 14 patients. Two cytopathologists blinded to the original cytology diagnosis reviewed the cytology and histology slides. The incidence, cytomorphologic features, diagnostic accuracy, factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy, and clinical impact of the cytology result were studied. ResultsThe incidence of NUM was <1%. The male:female ratio was 1.3. An abnormality was detected in 60% of the cases; however, in only 4% of the cases, a primary site was identified accurately. Of the false negatives, 96% was deemed as sampling errors and 4% was interpretational.

Sampling error attributed to the false-negative results. Necrosis and dirty background was often associated with metastatic lesions from colon. Obtaining history of a primary tumor elsewhere was a key factor in diagnosis of a metastatic lesion. Hematopoietic malignancies remain to be a diagnostic challenge.

Objective: Examine the usability, feasibility, and effectiveness of adapting an existing evidence-based weight loss program for people with IM. Methods: In this single-group pre-test post-test pilot study, 10 overweight or obese individuals with permanent IM (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, osteoarthritis) participated in a 20-week modification of the DPP Group Lifestyle BalanceTM (DPP GLB) program, a group-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Fifteen conference calls encouraged reducing calorie and fat intake and increasing exercise through self-monitoring and problem solving. We defined feasibility as retention and engagement, usability as participants' program satisfaction ratings, and effectiveness as physiological and psychosocial change measured on three occasions over 20 weeks. Analytic methods included basic descriptive statistics (feasibility and usability) and repeated measures ANOVA (effectiveness). Results: The program retained 70% of participants. These individuals attended an average of 79.3% of conference calls and self monitored more than half of the weeks. Participants rated the program highly, with mean overall scores of 6.3 +/- 0.3 and 6.2 +/- 0.6 out of 7 on helpfulness and satisfaction scales, respectively.

The galvanic corrosion of a high voltage conductor assembly consisting of a cylindrical CFRP rod surrounded by tightly wound aluminum wires has been investigated through experimental work and modeling. The main corrosion product is Al(OH)(3), which presents as a gelatinous substance in the crevices between the Al wires. The formation of Al(OH)(3) was observed to coincide with the decay in the galvanic corrosion current. A new analytical model was developed to investigate if the decay could be caused by corrosion products restricting the transport of oxygen to the cathode. Modeling of the oxygen diffusion through the deposited corrosion products generated galvanic corrosion rates that agreed well with the experimental measurements after an early exponential decay period. The findings suggest that the corrosion product deposition may be the most important galvanic corrosion rate controlling mechanism in this geometry and similar geometries.

The second procedure included depositing a colloid solution of nickel particles in toluene preliminary obtained by metal vapor synthesis (MVS). As a result in both cases Ni particles of 6 nm size were formed on the lignin surface. Both types of nanocatalysts govern the microwave (MW) assisted DR of lignin. MW treatment of the mechanical mixture of a carbon sorbent with a high dielectric loss factor, and a Ni-containing lignin sample obtained by the first method resulted in the 65 wt.% lignin conversion to synthesis gas with the H-2/CO ratio of similar to 1/1.

The Ni-containing lignin samples before and after reforming were investigated by XRD, TEM, EDA, and magnetic measurements. It was established that different depositing procedures lead to the formation of X-ray amorphous Ni particles with markedly different magnetic properties. In contrast to entirely paramagnetic sample obtained from nickel acetate solution, superparamagnetic Ni particles formed by MVS exhibited a high capacity for absorption of MWI, sufficient for plasma to be generated and the reforming temperature to be reached without an additional sorbent.

SAV3 infected salmon showed increased SOCS1 mRNA levels in heart correlating with increased viral transcripts. Together, the in vitro and in vivo data suggests that SAV3-induced SOCS1 expression may affect the outcome of the virus infection.

In data processing, in order to obtain the correlative data from the database, we employ just-in-time modeling. In the calculation of the predicted values, we propose a regression model for wind speed and wind power, and the unknown parameters are estimated using a constrained Kalman filter. Moreover, in the procedure used to estimate the unknown parameters, reduction and convergence of the variables are also guaranteed.

Characterization of the LIS/PAN NF confirmed its favorable structural and surface properties for effective Li+ adsorption. The LIS/PAN NF was mechanically suitable as a microfiltration membrane with high water flux and low pressure requirement. Breakthrough experiments at varied feed concentrations (C-f), seawater fiowrates (F), and NF thicknesses (Z) revealed the dynamic adsorption behavior of the filter. The seawater residence time was most critical and must be kept >= 0.12 min at any given C-f and Z to maximize the Li+ capacity of the filter. This can be conveniently achieved by adjusting the F of the process. Analogous to a packed bed system, the predictive power of nine breakthrough models were determined through non-linear regression analyses.

In this article, we illustrate the imaging findings of the spectrum of musculoskeletal infections, emphasizing the role of DWI in this domain. aEuro cent Abscess in background cellulitis is detected on DWI. aEuro cent Infectious tenosynovitis shows diffusion restriction as compared to mechanical tenosynovitis. aEuro cent Pyomyositis with abscess can be differentiated from diabetic myonecrosis on DWI. aEuro cent Intraosseous abscess is bright on DWI versus devitalized tissue, sequestrum and air. aEuro cent DWI can be used to differentiate spine infection from simple Modic changes.",2022,45,9,EG0UH,2019/07/02

The ground powders of the former are hydrated by only adding water at 80 degrees C for 3 days and 20 degrees C for subsequent time. Some one-part geopolymers gain satisfying compressive strengths and are quite water-resistant similar to the two-part ones. It is found that alkali alters and deepens the thermal decomposition of the bentonite and transforms quartz impurity into X-ray amorphous cementing-active glassy phases. Nepheline is usually generated in the alkali fused bentonite, and gehlenite also occurs when calcined at 1000 degrees C. Different kinds of zeolites appear in the one-part geopolymers, while the calcium ferrites, only found in the precursors exclusively activated by Na2CO3, lead to produce additional hydrous gehlenite, so Na2CO3 seems facilitates hydration more effective than NaOH given the pastes from the precursors calcined with Na2CO3 possess higher compressive strengths. Moreover, the ferric oxide and calcium oxide have potential to enhance the cementing properties according to the mechanisms with calcination and hydration. The low hydrolysis rate might lead to poor water-resistance and the softening coefficient of the pastes increases with alkali content and calcination temperature for one-part geopolymers.

Various immune signaling pathways and effectors have been shown to mediate a certain degree of defense specificity against different Plasmodium species. A key pattern recognition receptor of the Anopheles gambiae immune system is the fibrinogen domain-containing immunolectin FBN9, which has been shown to be transcriptonally induced by Plasmodium infection, and to mediate defense against both rodent and human malaria parasites and bacteria. Here we have further studied the defense specificity of FBN9 using a transgenic approach, in which FBN9 is overexpressed in the fat body tissue after a blood meal through a vitellogenin promoter. Interestingly, the Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes showed increased resistance only to the rodent parasite P. berghei, and not to the human parasite P. falciparum, pointing to differences in the mosquito's defense mechanisms against the two parasite species. The Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes were also more resistant to infection with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and showed increased longevity when infected with P. berghei. Our study points to the importance of both experimentally depleting and enriching candidate anti-Plasmodium effectors in functional studies in order to ascertain their suitability for the development of transgenic mosquito based malaria control strategies.

We aimed to find out whether mitochondrial measures are downregulated in obesity also in isolated adipocytes. We studied young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant (n = 14, intrapair difference Delta BMI >= 3 kg/m(2)) and concordant (n = 5, Delta BMI < 3 kg/m(2)) for BMI, identified from ten birth cohorts of 22- to 36-year-old Finnish twins. Abdominal body fat distribution (MRI), liver fat content (magnetic resonance spectroscopy), insulin sensitivity (OGTT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum lipids and adipokines were measured. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were obtained to analyse the transcriptomics patterns of the isolated adipocytes as well as of the whole adipose tissue. Mitochondrial DNA transcript levels in adipocytes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blots of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels in adipocytes were performed in obese and lean unrelated individuals. The heavier (BMI 29.9 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2)) co-twins of the discordant twin pairs had more subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat and were more insulin resistant (p < 0.01 for all measures) than the lighter (24.1 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) co-twins. Altogether, 2538 genes in adipocytes and 2135 in adipose tissue were significantly differentially expressed (nominal p < 0.05) between the co-twins. Pathway analysis of these transcripts in both isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue revealed that the heavier co-twins displayed reduced expression of genes relating to mitochondrial pathways, a result that was replicated when analysing the pathways behind the most consistently downregulated genes in the heavier co-twins (in at least 12 out of 14 pairs). Consistently upregulated genes in adipocytes were related to inflammation. We confirmed that mitochondrial DNA transcript levels (12S RNA, 16S RNA, COX1, ND5, CYTB), expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein transcripts and a major mitochondrial regulator PGC-1 alpha (also known as PPARGC1A) were reduced in the heavier co-twins' adipocytes (p < 0.05). OXPHOS protein levels of complexes I and III in adipocytes were lower in obese than in lean individuals.

Since the latter only contains propene and ethene in this idealized reactor configuration, the 1-pentene feed can be selectively converted to these lower olefins.

The composites were characterized by various techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurement through nitrogen adsorption at cryogenic temperature. Single component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were performed at different temperatures. The selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). MOF505@GO composites showed higher porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption compared to its parent compound MOF-505. MOF-505@5G0 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 3.94 mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa, having an increase of 37.3% in comparison with the parent MOF-505. The significant improvement of CO2 uptakes could be attributed to not only new micropores and unsaturated metal sites formed in the MOF505@GO, but also enhanced surface dispersive forces of the composites. The experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were well fitted with dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model.

Metaldehyde, used as the challenge molecule in this study, is a common molluscicide that (like many highly soluble contaminants) has frequently breached European regulatory limits in surface waters. The new method involves graphene with higher hydrophilic characteristics (single-layer graphene oxide, SLGO) as a system that participates in a redox reaction with hydrogen peroxide and which can potentially stabilize the OH generated, which subsequently breaks down organic contaminants. The modified Fenton's reaction has shown to be effective in degrading metaldehyde in natural waters (>92% removal), even at high contaminant concentrations (50 mg metaldehyde/L) and in the presence of high background organic matter and dissolved salts. The reaction is relatively pH insensitive. SLGO maintained its catalytic performance over 3 treatment cycles when immobilized. Its performance gradually decreased over time, reaching around 50% of starting performance on the 10th treatment cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of modifications caused in SLGO by the oxidizing treatment indicated that the oxidation of C-C sp(2) to carbonyl groups may be the cause of the decrease in performance. The proposed modified Fenton's process has the potential to substitute traditional Fenton's treatment although regeneration of the nanocarbon is required for its prolonged use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Glucose and graphite rod with stacked graphite granules were used as the substrate and electrode, respectively since they improved current density of MFC5 system and increased cathodic H2O2 synthesis. Both batch and continuous flow modes of MFCs were compared and the operational parameters for higher H2O2 yield were also studied. The results showed that for both batch and continuous flow modes, initially the H2O2 production had a rising trend and arrived at the highest level but subsequently it decreased. We later demonstrated that controlling pH at 3 would promote H2O2 accumulation. Integrating the in-situ H(2)O(2)synthesis and Fe2+ addition in the cathodic chamber, production of hydroxyl radicals was evidenced through salicylic acid degradation and formation of its hydroxyl products.

The contribution of the two removal mechanisms to the overall removal will vary with different ECs depending on the ECs reactivity in Fenton reaction.

By optimization of the operating conditions in terms of voltage, core/shell flow rate ratio as well as tPA volume ratio, minimum bubble sizes for tPA-BSA and tPA-lipid MBs were obtained. The fabricated tPA-BSA MBs was 41 mu m in mean diameter while similar to 41% of the tPA-lipid MBs ranged from 3 to 6 mu m and similar to 36% of them ranged from 6 to 9 mu m under optimal operating conditions.

Furthermore, it reduced insulin content, mitochondrial respiration and cellular ATP levels in clonal beta cells. Overexpression of Hdac7 also led to changes in the genome-wide gene expression pattern, including increased expression of Tcf7l2 and decreased expression of gene sets regulating DNA replication and repair as well as nucleotide metabolism. In accordance, Hdac7 overexpression reduced the number of beta cells owing to enhanced apoptosis. Finally, we found that inhibiting HDAC7 activity with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta cells that were overexpressing Hdac7. Taken together, these results indicate that increased HDAC7 levels caused beta cell dysfunction and may thereby contribute to defects seen in type 2 diabetic islets. Our study supports HDAC7 inhibitors as a therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",2021,331,14,EF1FR,2019/02/12

First, we confirmed the accuracy of the nonlinear analysis in the model test. Next, we carried out nonlinear transient electric field analysis for polarity reversal test of the converter transformer. In the results, when the applied time of dc voltage before the polarity reversal is 360 min, the values of the electric field of oil area are the same as when it is 90 min. Although, the electric field in the pressboard becomes higher in response to the applied time dc voltage, it does not cause a problem on the insulation. Because withstand voltage of pressboard is very high. In the results, the correlation between the applied time of dc voltage before the polarity reversal and the withstand voltage of transformer is considered low.

The main focus was the application of CdTe QDs involving a direct relationship between analyte sensing and QD photoluminescence modulation. Different strategies for adjusting this reactivity by means of surface modification or functionalization with suitable recognition groups allowing the targeting of specific analytes, are presented. The mechanisms involved in the QDs photoluminescence (PL) modulation associated to the analyte signaling process, such as charge and energy transfer, defects passivation, non-radiative recombination, etc, are also discussed.

And thus, we propose a new strategy to enhance the steam stability of Cu-BTC (HKUST-1). In this work, Cu-BTC was functionalized with imidazole (Imi) to yield Imi@Cu-BTC. The novel Imi@Cu-BTC can be quickly synthesized within 1-min at room temperature. Successful incorporation of Imi on Cu-BTC was proved by FT-IR spectra. The as-synthesized Imi(1/3)@Cu-BTC was of a decent BET surface area up to 1694 m(2)/g, and exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 4.4 mmol/g at 1 bar and room temperature, which was well above that of ZIF-8, UiO-66 and MIL-101. More interestingly, the steam stability of Imi@Cu-BTC was significantly improved compared to that of Cu-BTC. While Cu-BTC almost lost all its crystallinity and only retained 6% of its original CO2 capacity after being exposed to humid air for 20 days, Imi(1/3)@Cu-BTC managed to preserve its main crystal structure and preserved 78% of its initial CO2 capacity after the exposure. The origination of the improved steam stability of Imi@Cu-BTC was interpreted by DFT calculations. In conclusion, the strategy of incorporating Imi into Cu-BTC is very efficient in improving its structure stability against moisture due to the protection of Cu sites from Imi, and the ultrafast room temperature synthesis is promising for the scalable production of MOF-based materials.

A fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) performing denitrification via thiosulfate (S2O32-) oxidation of a nitrate-contaminated synthetic wastewater was first operated under decreasing feed pH values from 7.00 to 5.25. Denitrification efficiency > 99% was observed even at feed and effluent pH of 5.75 and 5.30, respectively. At lower feed pH values, the denitrification efficiency decreased rapidly due to inorganic carbon deficiency. The addition of a carbonation unit continuously feeding anaerobic grade CO2 to the FBR biofilm allowed to investigate denitrification at pH values lower than 5.0. This new configuration, i.e. FBR with a carbonation unit, was able to sustain a complete and stable denitrification even at pH as low as 4.75. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed the evolution of the denitrifying biofilm during the FBR operation, resulting in a robust and high-performing mixotrophic consortium of chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria dominated by T. denitrificans. Batch activity tests performed at three different stages of the FBR operation (feed pH 7.0, 6.0 and 5.25) showed that low pH cultivation enhanced the denitrification activity (mg N/g VS d) of the FBR biofilm at acidic pH values.

Three varieties of TRAb have been described: stimulating (S-TRAb), blocking (B-TRAb), and apoptotic (A-TRAb) autoantibodies. Very recently, the first immunoassay method (Immulite TSI assay, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) declared to measure serum S-TRAb concentration, has been made available in an automated commercial platform. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of this new test to identify patients suffering from GD, in comparison with two current IMA methods for total TSH receptor autoantibodies (T-TRAb) measurement. Methods: Sera of 383 subjects [72 patients with untreated GD, 55 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), 36 patients with multinodular non-toxic goiter, 100 patients with other non-thyroid autoimmune diseases (NTAD) and 120 healthy subjects (HS)] were evaluated. Results: The threshold obtained by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 0.54 IU/L, very similar to that proposed by the manufacturer (0.55 IU/L). -Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) were-positive in all GD patients and negative in all but three controls (clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98.7%, respectively). Passing and Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plot showed an acceptable agreement between TSI Immulite assay and other two immunoassay methods (Cobas/Elecsys, Roche and TRAK RIA, BRAHMS Thermo Scientific). Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of fully automated Immulite TSI assay in GD patients is at least comparable to that of current TRAb immunoassays (IMAs) suggesting the possibility of including such assay in rapid and cost-saving diagnostic and monitoring algorithms. However, our results do not provide full evidence that this assay is specific for S-TRAb only, and future studies comparing Immulite TSI assay to stimulating activity are required.",2019,330,12,ED7YG,2019/01/30

The aim of this study was to determine individual cytopathologists' rates of indeterminate diagnoses in EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions and their relationship to cytopathologists' experience and volume of pancreatic EUS-FNA examined, as well as the potential impact of departmental consensus review on indeterminate diagnoses. DesignThe diagnostic rates of ATY and SUSP and their underlying risk of malignancy were calculated for six cytopathologists who diagnosed 1,114 of 1,225 EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions from 1/1/2001 to 9/15/2014, and were then compared for the periods before and after the implementation of departmental consensus review during 2009. ResultsThe six cytopathologists diagnosed 10% of cases as indeterminate; 82 (7.4%) as atypical and 29 (2.6%) as suspicious. The individual cytopathologists' indeterminate diagnosis rates varied twofold (6.67-12.80%) and did not correlate with their experience, total or annual volume of EUS-FNAs. Of the 56/99 (56.57%) cases with follow-up, the underlying rate of malignancy was 47% (35/75; for atypical and 87.5% (21/24); for suspicious). The underlying rates of malignancy were 33-67% for atypical and 80-100% for suspicious diagnoses made by individual cytopathologists. The rate of indeterminate diagnoses decreased from 11.55 to 7.88% after the implementation of departmental consensus review.

Interestingly, ER beta is also expressed in some head kidney lymphocytes but not in naive PBLs. Immune stimulation altered the cell type specific profile of expression of these receptors, which depends on both activation and maturation stage. This implies direct leukocyte responsiveness to estrogen stimulation and therefore in vitro effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in monocytesimacrophages were determined. Short-time incubation with E2 increased ROS production in PMA-stimulated cells. Results comply with mediation by GPR30, partially functioning via phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation.

The asymmetric feeding of solids can be caused by the designed-geometry of J-bend right before the riser inlet or unbalanced operation of wall-steam feeding. In order to ensure uniform distributions in local catalytic to oil ratio (CTO) and temperature, a possible measure of matching the asymmetric feed of catalysts is to introduce liquid jets in an accordingly asymmetric feeding. The asymmetric feeding will cause complicated three-phase interactions, in terms of the transport and phase change characteristics of each interacting phase, in the feed zone of a riser reactor. This study has developed a theoretical framework with an inertia-based multi-spray interaction, which considers not only a complex geometric intervene of mutual-penetration sprays but also the individual spray properties and feeding operations. Based on the fact that the traverse gradient of pressure is insignificant compared to that of axial gradient in a riser flow, a sub-model is also established to redistribute the gas and solid phases within the cross-section of concern. Due to the lack of experiment data or available information on the asymmetric feeding of catalysts from J-bend, we have also conducted a CFD study of a J-bend dense gas solid flow to obtain the asymmetric distribution catalysts feeding to the feed-zone model. Our modeling examples suggest that the reaction and flow characteristics can be altered noticeably by adjusting asymmetric feedings of liquid reactants, such as changes in droplet penetration, spray coverage and local CTO. In addition, the result of over-penetration of droplets onto the feed zone wall shows the need for a various droplet size/flowrate model rather than mono-sized/constant-flowrate model of liquid phase. This can also assist in better design or selection of the characteristics for the spray nozzle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,22,9,ED5YS,2019/10/04

TiO2 and AgiTiO(2) were prepared by a solvothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. The activity of the photocatalysts was evaluated by decomposition rate of NO and yield of N-2, respectively. It was found that although photodecomposition of NO over pure TiO2 is very quick, NO has not been converted into N-2 and O-2. It means that some by-products have formed. N-2 formation is a relatively slower process. It was found that the selectivity for photodecomposition of NOx into N-2 can be significantly improved by introducing appropriate amount of Ag into TiO2. The 1 wt% Ag loaded on TiO2 showed the highest activity for both NO decomposition and N-2 production. The possible mechanism for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of anatase AgiTiO(2) was attributed to the coexistence of Ag and Ag+ on the surface of TiO2, with a Ag+/Ag ratio of ca. 0.86, which played different roles in the photo catalytic process.

We speculated that the intensity that had positive (16 T) or negative (500 nT and 0.2 T) effects on osteoblast differentiation would inversely influence osteoclast differentiation. To answer this question, we examined the profound effects of SMFs on osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells. Here, we demonstrated that 500 nT and 0.2 T SMFs promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation and resorption, while 16 T had an inhibitory effect. Almost all the osteoclastogenic genes were highly expressed under 500 nT and 0.2 T, including RANK, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), V-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase II (Car2) and cathepsin K (CTSK), whereas they were decreased under 16 T. In addition, 16 T disrupted actin formation with remarkably decreased integrin 3 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that osteoclast differentiation could be regulated by altering the intensity of SMF, which is just contrary to that on osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, studies of SMF effects could reveal some parameters that could be used as a physical therapy for various bone disorders.",2019,95,6,ED7SA,2018/09/04

Conventional separation methods are high costly, energy intensive and environmentally unfriendly. Permeation separation based on membrane separation technique is a promising technology with advantages of energy efficient, clean and no additives. However, lots of organic compounds are commonly used for the traditional preparation of various membranes for enantioseparation of racemic tryptophan. Thus, we developed a totally green and clean preparation method using nature polymer sodium alginate as functional polymer, water as solvent and CaCl2 as crosslinking agent. Besides, polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was selected as supported membrane. Molecularly imprinted technology with D-Tryptophan as template molecule was introduced to enlarge mass transfer flux. Various methods were used in characterization of molecularly imprinted composite membrane (MICM) and non-imprinted composite membrane (NICM). Effects of preparing conditions, permeation conditions and concentration polarization on permeation performance of MICM by pressure-driven were investigated. High enantiomeric excess (ee% > 98%) of the permeation solution could be obtained under mild conditions. Reducing the presence of concentration polarization was beneficial to maintaining high ee% (>98%). Moreover, the thermo and chemical stability of MICM were studied too. Comparison with previous studies indicated that the proposed totally green and clean method was not only low costly and environment friendly but also beneficial to significantly increasing ee.

To investigate the effects of EMP on gelatinase of BBB, an in vitro BBB model was established using primary cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC), astrocytes and half-contact culture of these cells in a transwell chamber. Cultured supernatant and cells were collected at different time points after exposure to EMP (peak intensity 400 kV/m, rise time 10 ns, pulse width 350 ns, 0.5 pps and 200 pulses). Protein levels of cellular gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9, and endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were detected by Western blot. The activity of gelatinase in culture supernatant was detected by gelatin zymography. It was found that compared with the sham-exposed group, the protein level of MMP-2 was significantly increased at 6 h (p < 0.05), and the protein level of its endogenous inhibitor TIMP-2 did not change after EMP exposure. In addition, the protein levels of MMP-9 and its endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1 did not change after EMP exposure. Gelatin zymography results showed that the activity of MMP-2 in the inner pool and the outer pool of the transwell chamber was significantly increased at 6 h after EMP exposure compared with that of the sham group.

Considering the targeted application for non-structural building material, the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths as well as the water absorption of the mortars were evaluated. The incorporation of POFA and polymer fibres (polypropylene and acrylic) exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction generally reduced the thermal conductivity and compressive strength as well as increased the water absorption of the mortars. Although the inclusion of POFA did not reduce the strength loss upon exposure to elevated temperature, the addition of fibres above 0.3% had slight effect in reducing the compressive strength loss. Thus, based on the optimization in terms of the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths, it is recommended to incorporate high volume POFA and addition of polymer fibres exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction for non-structural application in building materials.

Monomolecular protolytic cracking routes were mainly initiated by attack of acid sites on C-H or C-2-C-3 bonds. Operating conditions or zeolite pore caliber can tailor not only the first scission, but also the balance among carbenium ions related routes, e.g. hydride transfer, deprotonation, side reactions, etc. Increasing reaction temperature or zeolite pore caliber promoted the cleavage of C-H bond, and large pore caliber and high conversion were beneficial to the hydride transfer and side reactions. Compared to HZSM-35 and H-Beta, HZSM-5 zeolite with middle pore caliber exhibited the highest selectivity to light olefins, and Agincorporation can further promoted selectivity to light olefins at a little cost of P/E (propylene to ethylene) ratio. Promotion of Ag-incorporation on light olefins formation was probably due to the active sites generated by silver species acting as dehydrogenation sites, and enhancing the cleavage of C-H bond.

However, the cost of carbon capture has to be reduced to manageable levels before it can be deployed at an industrial scale. Potassium carbonate solutions (K2CO3) are good solvents for CO2 capture because they have low regeneration energy, low degradation rates and low corrosivity. However, one shortcoming of K2CO3 is that it has slow reaction kinetics with CO2. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of promoters to K2CO3 solutions. In this study, the catalysis kinetics of a carbonic anhydrase (NZCA) promoter was tested via the stopped flow technique and a wetted wall column (WWC). The Michaelis-Menten catalysis parameter (k(cat)/K-m) was determined to be 2.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) at 298 K, allowing the catalysis reaction activation energy of 51 +/- 1 kJ/mol to be obtained at 298-328 K. The catalysis coefficient of the NZCA was determined to be 5.3 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) using a WWC in 30 wt% potassium carbonate solutions (pH similar to 11-12) at 323 K. Furthermore, the NZCA maintained more than 70% of its initial catalysis efficiency after continuously running for 8 h in 30 wt% K2CO3 solutions at pH of 10.6-10.8 and temperature of 323 K.

ISFC was used as a partial replacement of cement from 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% to 40% by weight of Portland cement (OPC). The powder materials were design to have three total powder contents of 450, 550 and 650 kg/m(3), whereas the water-powder (OPC plus ISFC) material ratio for all mixtures was kept constant at 0.40. The mixtures were designed to produce a controlled slump flow diameter of 700 +/- 25 mm. Tests were performed on all mixtures to determine the properties of fresh SCC in terms of workability and stability.

Of late, however, it is predicted that further-oxidizable gas-state molecules, such as CO, hydrocarbons, play a crucial role in an SO-CFC operation. In this work, we controlled an anode chamber atmosphere by providing an inert purging gas to verify the role of carbon-induced gas-state molecules; that is, some experiments were carried out with a purging gas and the others were without a purging gas. Additionally, in some of the experiments, alumina wool was placed between carbon and a cell to prevent a solid-state fuel from reaching anode surface, i.e. alumina wool is a gas diffusion layer between a solid-state fuel and anode surface. As a result, maximum power density of 230 mW cm(-2) was obtained when the test was taken under no Ar without alumina wool; 80 mW cm(-2) under Ar flow without alumina wool; 212 mW cm(-2) under no Ar with alumina wool; potential value going zero under Ar with alumina wool. In other words, it is corroborated that gas-state molecules mainly govern power performance and hence SO-CFC operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,58,8,ED7YG,2019/02/08

Sewage sludge was first torrefied in an auger reactor under two different conditions: temperature of 250 degrees C and 275 degrees C and average solid residence times of 13 min and 24 min, respectively. Pyrolysis was conducted at 530 degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor. The catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors was carried out in a fixed bed reactor using gamma-alumina (gamma-Al2O3) as a catalyst. The experimental results showed that the combination of the torrefaction pre-treatment with the catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors did not noticeably improved the properties of the liquid organic phases for use as a fuel, in terms of O/C molar ratio and nitrogen content, compared to pyrolysis of sewage sludge with the same catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors but without the torrefaction pre-treatment. Generally, the torrefaction did not have effect on the type of chemical families identified in the liquid phases and had little effect on the proportion of these families. The advantages of the combination of treatments were, on the one hand, the catalyst saving resulting from the lower amount of vapors generated by the pyrolysis of torrefied sewage sludge and, on the other hand, the slight decrease in the coke yield.

A significant CO2 capacity improvement of up to 36% was achieved. It was found that higher CO2 uptakes were related to removal of inorganic impurities i.e. mineral matter and increase of the submicropores volume i.e. smaller than 0.8 nm. Sorbents were thoroughly characterized in terms of texture and chemical composition. CO2 uptake was determined by BET isotherm measurement carried out at 273 K and pressure of up to 0.95 bar. The enhancement of CO2 uptake was observed especially for ACs with the highest initial mineral matter content. It was found that mineral matter in ACs plays the role of a ballast and additionally blocks adsorption places and submicropores volume thus lowers CO2 uptake. On the other hand it was proven that mineral matter may prevent the structure from collapsing and thus can stabilize high SSA. The AC surface oxidation effect on CO2 uptake was determined by comparison of ACs treated with HCI and HNO3. Both acids remove mineral matter content to the same degree, but detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study revealed that in case of HNO3 treatment, AC surface was more oxidized which correlated with higher CO2 uptake.

Two alternative methods are to use three different mixing processes with preheated materials and to use two thermogenetic admixtures (hot pack material and quicklime).

For the use of a thermogenetic admixture, the results from compressive strength testing, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) micrographs and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirm that quicklime is more efficient than hot pack material.

In this study, we report that zebrafish STAT6 is induced during SVCV infection and reduces IFN phi 1 expression by suppressing TBK1 phosphorylation. A typical IFN stimulatory response element (ISRE) motif was found in the promoter region of zebrafish STAT6, and zebrafish STAT6 transcription was significantly upregulated in the early stages of virus infection. Overexpression of STAT6 interfered with IFN phi 1 promoter activity in response to SVCV infection. Additionally, TBK1-, but not MITA-mediated activation of the IFN phi 1 promoter was impaired by STAT6. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments indicated that MITA and IRF3 were significantly phosphorylated by TBK1, and that the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 was critical in this process. In the final step, STAT6 interacted with the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 causing dephosphorylation, which resulted in reductions in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the production of IFN phi 1. These results indicate that fish STAT6 can attenuate the kinase activity of TBK1, leading to suppression of IFN phi 1 expression which may in turn facilitate virus replication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The IO@CaCO3 adsorbent removed both anionic (As(V) and Cr(VI)) and cationic (Pb(II)) heavy metal ions at a rate orders of magnitude faster than any conventional adsorbents reported to date; due to synergistic effect of needle-like IO and CaCO3, it completely removed (99.99%) the toxic heavy metal ions from wastewater in only 9 min. In addition, it exhibited excellent As(V), Cr(VI), and Pb(II) removal capacities of 184.1, 251.6, and 1041.9 mg g(-1), respectively, over a wide pH range. The heavy metal ion adsorption mechanism involves ion-exchange reactions between the cationic/anionic heavy metal ions and the positively/negatively charged groups on the adsorbent. Along with the batch adsorption tests, heavy metal ion removal by IO@CaCO3 was also performed by column filtration, demonstrating the potential of IO@CaCO3 for use in practical applications. Moreover, the excellent removal efficiencies of the adsorbent for the heavy metal ions up to drinking water level and its easy separation by an external magnetic field enabled it to be effectively reused.

The high-temperature reactor contains a reactor column having micrometer sized solid particles, and is connected to an optical window using transparent fused-silica capillary tubing. Liquid samples are exposed for the second time scale, which can be adjusted by changing the flow rate. In situ monitoring of reactions using SSCM-HF was performed at 200-1114 nm within 7.36-117.79 s at temperatures up to 300 degrees C and pressures up to 30 MPa.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces. It might be of interest to explore the transfer of colloids along or inside real surfaces (being a mosaic of nano-or micro-scale domaines with specific interactions).",2019,158,7,EF1JQ,2018/12/04

In insects, mediators of the stress response (e.g. stress hormones) divert molecular resources away from immune function and towards tissues necessary for fight-or-flight behaviours. For example, molecules such as lipid transport proteins are involved in both the stress and immune responses, leading to a reduction in disease resistance when these proteins are shifted towards being part of the stress response system. Stress responses also alter immune system strategies (i.e. reconfiguration) to compensate for resource losses that occur during fight-or flight events. In addition, stress responses optimize immune function for different physiological conditions. In insects, the stress response induces a pro-inflammatory state that probably enhances early immune responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2020,668,8,EF2VG,2019/04/08

The results showed that the removal of TC increased with increasing initial H2O2 dosage, pH and treatment time, and about 97% of TC was removed by H2O2 with the concentration of 174 mM in alkaline aqueous solution. Experiments with different scavengers indicated that TC degradation occurred via a direct molecular reaction instead of active radicals.

Findings regarding service use among persons with disabilities supports the notion of disparities but provides inconsistent evidence of underuse of recommended care. Objective: To examine the extent to which receipt of recommended care among older Medicare beneficiaries varies by disability status, using a newly developed staging method to classify individuals according to disability. Methods: In a cohort study, we included community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who participated in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey between 2001 and 2008. Logistic regression modeling assessed the association of receiving recommended care on 38 indicators across different activity limitation stages. Results: Nearly one out of every three elderly Medicare beneficiaries did not receive overall recommended care. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) revealed a decrease in use of recommended care with increasing activity limitation stage. For instance, ORs (95% CIs) across mild, moderate, severe and complete limitation stages (stages I-IV) compared to no limitation (stage 0) in ADLs were 0.99 (0.94-1.05), 0.89 (0.83-0.95), 0.81 (0.75-0.89) and 0.56 (0.46-0.68).

Conclusions: Elderly beneficiaries at higher activity limitation stages experienced substantial disparities in receipt of recommended care.

However, the efficiency of an electromagnetic resonant coupling type WPT system with LC resonators is greatly affected by the layout of the LC resonators allocated in the system. This means that there is an optimum layout for the LC resonators for transferring wireless power at higher efficiency. This paper presents a new method for identifying the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. One of the key ideas is that the problem of finding the optimum layout is replaced by the problem of calculating the equivalent current sources in the LC resonators. The amplitude of the equivalent current sources can be calculated to solve ill-posed system equations by using inverse analysis. First, the proposed method is described. The system equations to be solved are formulated by means of equivalent circuit techniques. Second, the proposed method is applied to a simplified model to identify the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. Then, the results found using the proposed method are verified by comparing the ratio of receiving power with the identified layout and without the LC resonator. Finally, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, the calculated results are compared with the experiment results using the same model.

The presence of CO2 in the inlet gas decreases the SO2 adsorption capacity of the carbon. However, the presence of NO does not produce any significant change in the adsorption of SO2, at the studied conditions. The breakthrough curves of the SO2 adsorption are predicted adequately by a rigorous mathematical model that takes into account the catalytic oxidation of SO2 by an Eley-Rideal mechanism and the reaction between adsorbed SO3 and water vapor to produce H2SO4, followed by the elution of the adsorbed H2SO4 that releases the active sites.

However, the efficiency of an electromagnetic resonant coupling type WPT system with LC resonators is greatly affected by the layout of the LC resonators allocated in the system. This means that there is an optimum layout for the LC resonators for transferring wireless power at higher efficiency. This paper presents a new method for identifying the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. One of the key ideas is that the problem of finding the optimum layout is replaced by the problem of calculating the equivalent current sources in the LC resonators. The amplitude of the equivalent current sources can be calculated to solve ill-posed system equations by using inverse analysis. First, the proposed method is described. The system equations to be solved are formulated by means of equivalent circuit techniques. Second, the proposed method is applied to a simplified model to identify the optimum layout for the LC resonators in a WPT system. Then, the results found using the proposed method are verified by comparing the ratio of receiving power with the identified layout and without the LC resonator. Finally, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, the calculated results are compared with the experiment results using the same model.

We compute the model parameters in the MPC using a simple and systematic method based on a priori available patient information. We describe and compare 3 different model structures. The first model structure is an autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous input (ARIMAX) structure. The second model structure is an autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model, i.e. a model without an integrator. The third model structure is an adaptive ARMAX model in which we use a recursive extended least squares (RELS) method to estimate parameters of the stochastic part. In addition, we describe some safety layers in the control algorithm that improve the controller robustness and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. We test and compare our control strategies using a virtual clinic of 100 randomly generated patients with a representative inter subject variability. This virtual clinic is based on the Hovorka model. We consider the case where only half of the meal bolus is administered at mealtime, and the case where the insulin sensitivity increases during the night. The numerical results suggest that the use of an integrator leads to higher occurrence of hypoglycemia than for the controllers without the integrator. Compared to other control strategies, the adaptive MPC reduces both the time spent in hypoglycemia and the time spent in hyperglycemia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To do that, experiments were carried out in a pseudo-2D fluidized bed using glass beads as bed material. The glass beads have the same density and diameter but half of them are painted in black to make them distinguishable. At the beginning of each experiment, the particles were placed in a completely lateral segregated state and then the fluidizing air was suddenly injected while images were recorded. The images were processed to obtain the mixing index evolution with time. Two different regions where differentiated in the evolution of the lateral mixing with time: a region dominated by convective mixing and a region governed by diffusive mixing. Both the start-up time and the total solids mixing time were characterized. The total solids mixing time was found to have a potential relation with the excess gas velocity and it was found to be independent of the particle size. This total solids mixing time was compared to the residence time of the bubbles in the bed and it was showed that the axial solids mixing is two orders of magnitude faster than the lateral solids mixing. This result justifies the use of the 1D Fickian-type diffusion equation to fit the experimental data of the mixing index obtaining the values of the lateral dispersion coefficient. Finally, the experimental values of the total solids mixing time were compared to the experimental values of the lateral dispersion coefficient and a straightforward relation between both parameters was provided.

In this study, the complete coding sequence of four g-type lysozymes were identified in Ciona intestinalis. Phylogenetic analysis and modelling supported the hypothesis of a close relationship with the vertebrate g-type lysozymes suggesting that the C intestinalis g-type lysozyme genes (CiLys-g1, CiLys-g2, CiLys-g3, CiLys-g4) share a common ancestor in the chordate lineage. Protein motif searches indicated that C intestinalis g-type lysozymes contain a GEWL domain with a GXXQ signature, typical of goose lysozymes. Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis results showed that transcripts are expressed in various tissues from C intestinalis. In order to determine the involvement of C intestinalis g-type lysozymes in immunity, their expression was analyzed in the pharynx, showing that transcripts were significantly up-regulated in response to a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data support the view that CiLys g-type are molecules with potential for immune defense system against bacterial infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, excessive usage of antibiotics resulted in development of multi drug resistant pathogens which made researchers to focus on AMPs as potential substitute for antibiotics. Lily type mannose-binding lectin is an extended super-family. of structurally and evolutionarily related sugar binding proteins. These lectins are well-known AMPs which play important roles in fish defense mechanism. Here, we report a full-length lily type lectin-2 (LTL-2) identified from the cDNA library of striped murrel, Channa striatus (Cs). CsLTL-2 protein contained B-lectin domain along with three carbohydrate binding sites which is a prominent characteristic functional feature of LTL. The mRNA transcripts of CsLTL-2 were predominantly expressed in gills and considerably up-regulated upon infection with fungus (Aphanomyces invadans) and bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila). To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the carbohydrate binding region of CsLTL-2, the region was synthesized (QP13) and its bactericidal activity was analyzed. In addition, QP13 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and its binding affinity with the bacterial cell membranes was analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration assay revealed that QP13 inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 80 mu M/ml. Confocal microscopic observation showed that FITC tagged QP13 specifically bound to the bacterial membrane. Fluorescence assisted cell sorter (FACS) assay showed that QP13 reduced the bacterial cell count drastically. Therefore, the mechanism of action of QP13 on E. coli cells was determined by propidium iodide internalization assay which confirmed that QP13 induced bacterial membrane disruption. Moreover, the peptide did not show any cytotoxicity towards fish peripheral blood leucocytes. Taken together, these results support the potentiality of QP13 that can be used as an antimicrobial agent against the tested pathogens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

A strategy to form cross links between the impregnated amines was introduced to prevent these problems. Crosslinkers with two amine-reactive groups such as epoxy and halide were used to prepare crosslinked polyethyleneimine (PEI)-impregnated sorbents. A viscosity increase was observed in all crosslinked PEIs. The structure and the amine ratio of the crosslinked PEIs were investigated by C-13 NMR analysis. The highest reaction selectivity to primary amines and the formation of hydroxyl groups were observed for 1,3-butadienediepoxide (BDDE). In addition, BDDE-crosslinked PEI-impregnated sorbents exhibited the most stable long-term stability with the highest CO2 adsorption capacity and the smallest weight gain after regeneration by simulated temperature swing adsorption (TSA) operations; the hydroxyl groups produced from BDDE-crosslinked PEI enhanced the CO2 utilization by acting as proton acceptors. The effect of the BDDE content was investigated. The advanced physical stability was observed by an increase in the viscosity at high temperatures or gelation with increasing amounts of BDDE. The BDDE-crosslinked PEI-impregnated sorbents with the appropriate amount of BDDE showed an outstanding stability for the cyclic adsorption capacity (determined by simulated TSA operations) and resistance to urea formation (indicated by in situ infrared analysis).

Some of the strategies discussed involve polymer and lipid conjugation with the drug moiety to impart hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, or to target nutrient transporters by conjugation with transporter-specific moieties and retrometabolic drug design. Expert opinion: The application of prodrug strategies provides an option for enhancing drug penetration into the ocular tissues, and overall ocular bioavailability, with minimum disruption of the ocular diffusion barriers.

However, the cost of carbon capture has to be reduced to manageable levels before it can be deployed at an industrial scale. Potassium carbonate solutions (K2CO3) are good solvents for CO2 capture because they have low regeneration energy, low degradation rates and low corrosivity. However, one shortcoming of K2CO3 is that it has slow reaction kinetics with CO2. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of promoters to K2CO3 solutions.

Continuous percentile charts from birth to adulthood allow accurate consideration of these dynamics and seem reasonable for an analyte as closely linked to growth as alkaline phosphatase. However, the ethical and practical challenges unique to pediatric reference intervals have restricted the creation of such percentile charts, resulting in limitations when clinical decisions are based on alkaline phosphatase activity. Methods: We applied an indirect method to generate percentile charts for alkaline phosphatase activity using clinical laboratory data collected during the clinical care of patients. A total of 361,405 samples from 124,440 patients from six German tertiary care centers and one German laboratory service provider measured between January 2004 and June 2015 were analyzed. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity was performed on Roche Cobas analyzers using the IFCC's photometric method. Results: We created percentile charts for alkaline phosphatase activity in girls and boys from birth to 18 years which can be used as reference intervals. Additionally, data tables of age- and sex-specific percentile values allow the incorporation of these results into laboratory information systems. Conclusions: The percentile charts provided enable the appropriate differential diagnosis of changes in alkaline phosphatase activity due to disease and changes due to physiological development. After local validation, integration of the provided percentile charts into result reporting facilitates precise assessment of alkaline phosphatase dynamics in pediatrics.",2018,198,1,EB1VJ,2019/05/05

In preceding research, it has been shown that the D-axis negative current reduces the 2nd radial electromagnetic force. In contrast, a relationship between this force and the current has not been clarified. In this paper, it is demonstrated that this force is separated into three forces caused by the D-axis current, the Q-axis current, and the flux of the magnet. An equation correlating this force and the current is developed by using a finite element analysis. On the basis of this equation, vibration control is proposed to reduce this force. In addition, this proposed method is verified by experiment. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,69,15,DX5QL,2018/09/28

This highly fossiliferous deposit (the Ten Bits Microsite') yielded about 5000 teeth, spines, and denticles in a small amount of matrix (c. 150 kg). About 30 identifiable species of sharks, rays, and bony fishes are recognized. Two of the three most abundant chondrichthyan species at Ten Bits (Scapanorhynchus texanus and Ischyrhiza mira) are also the most common species in other middle to late Campanian marine vertebrate faunas along the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain. The myliobatiform rays Brachyrhizodus and Rhombodus that occur at Ten Bits also appear to be characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, as are lamniform sharks such as Cretalamna and Serratolamna. These taxa are entirely absent or extremely rare in Western Interior Campanian faunas. In contrast, some small orectolobiform sharks (Cantioscyllium, Chiloscyllium, Columbusia) and small rays (Protoplatyrhina) found at Ten Bits are common in shallow water faunas of the Western Interior and Texas Coastal Plain, but rarely reported from the eastern Gulf or Atlantic Coast. The common Western Interior ray Myledaphus bipartitus does not occur at Ten Bits or in any Gulf or Atlantic Coast fauna. Ptychotrygon agujaensis is abundantly represented in the Ten Bits fauna, but unknown in correlative marine faunas. Although Ptychotrygon occurs in all Western Interior, Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas, it is represented elsewhere by apparently endemic species at each collection site. The differences between Western Interior, Gulf, and Atlantic Coastal Plain faunas probably reflect latitudinal variation in water temperature or salinity, or different oceanic water circulation patterns between the Western Interior Seaway and the Gulf or Atlantic Coast that restricted the distributions of some marine fish species. The Ten Bits fauna shares typical species with both Western Interior and Gulf and Atlantic Coast faunas, reflecting its position at the border between these provinces; however, the dominant taxa found at Ten Bits are the same as those found on the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and indicate that western Texas was more closely allied biogeographically with that province than with the Western Interior of North America. One species tentatively identified in the Ten Bits fauna on the basis of a single tooth, Igdabatis cf. I. indicus, is otherwise known only from southern Europe and Asia, although a similar large myliobatid ray also occurs rarely in Texas Coastal Plain faunas. These occurrences indicate that western Texas may have been near the northern limit of the range for some tropical Tethyan marine vertebrate species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The single-event kinetic modeling concept is used to optimize a recycle reactor for 1-pentene cracking on ZSM-5. A flow scheme for this kind of reactor is presented in which the reactor outlet stream is separated into C-4(=)-C-12(=) olefins for recycle and into the product stream consisting of propene and ethene. Since the latter only contains propene and ethene in this idealized reactor configuration, the 1-pentene feed can be selectively converted to these lower olefins. The validity of the applied single-event kinetic model to different feed olefins is shown by comparing simulated product distributions obtained for 1-hexene, 1-pentene and 1-butene as feed to own experiments and literature results.

However, the relatively large crystallite size of Ag3PO4 lowers its light response, while the high conduction band potential intensifies the reduction to Ag by the light induced electron, limiting the practical application of Ag3PO4. To overcome these drawbacks, we herein adopted a facile liquid phase deposition method to load Ag3PO4 onto amino-modified biochar which is an abundant and cheap byproduct of biomass pyrolysis to prepare renewable energy. The as-prepared composite (Ag/Ag3PO4/AMB) exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance to amoxicillin degradation compared with pure Ag3PO4. The results show that almost 80% amoxicillin was decomposed in 120 min in the presence of Ag/Ag3PO4/AMB, whereas only 65% of the amoxicillin was degraded with pure Ag3PO4. Multiple characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), MR, Raman, and XPS revealed that Ag3PO4 particles were evenly distributed on the surface of biochar, and a few Ag NPs were also generated due to the reduction effect of AMB. IJV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) analysis revealed that the composite had good visible light response, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicated AMB improved the efficiency of charge separation and electron transfer. In addition, EPR determination suggested that the oxidant formed in photocatalysis systems under visible light irradiation plays an important role in the degradation of amoxicillin.

The fractionation was performed in two stages: at 180 degrees C optimizing the hemicellulose extraction and at 260 degrees C extracting cellulose and hard hemicellulose remaining in the biomass structure. Three water flows were tested: 11, 17 and 26 cm(3)/min. Sugar yields from 71 to 75% were reached, mainly composed of xylose and glucose oligomers and lower amounts of other chemicals, like retro-aldol products, acetic acid or 5-HMF. The outlet stream from the fractionation reactor was directly mixed with sub or supercritical water at the inlet mixer of a supercritical hydrolysis reactor where the reaction time was precisely controlled. The temperature, pressure and reaction time were modified to get an insight of their effect on the yield of retro-aldol condensation products. Yields of 24% for glycolaldehyde, and pyruvaldehyde were found at 83 s, 350 degrees C and 162 bar (hydrolysis reactor conditions).

To date, biological treatment has been employed before it is released into water bodies to minimize the environmental hazards. However, the dark brownish colour of the effluent is still a big challenge to be addressed. In regard to this concern, membrane separation can serve as an attractive solution for this issue. This paper aims to investigate the performance of ultrafiltration nanocomposite membrane embedded with coupled zinc-iron oxide (ZIO) for the decolourization of POME. The ZIO was synthesized through the solution combustion technique by employing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as the precursors and urea as the fuel. The nanocomposite flat sheet membrane was prepared via phase inversion process. The physico-chemical properties of the MMMs were analysed using zeta potential analysis, SEM, BET and contact angle. Continuous filtration test was carried out to evaluate the capability of the MMMs for colour and COD removal. The results showed that the increase in the ZIO loading has drastically increased the membrane surface negativity and led to the colour removal of 70%. In addition, with the addition of M0.5, the permeation and colour removal had increased 25% and 17% respectively, compared to the pristine PVDF membrane. However, the long term filtration test revealed that the structure of M0.5 collapsed after 4 cycles of washing, but M2.0 still retained its performance. In a nutshell, this study demonstrated that negative surface charge has improved the antifouling properties meanwhile hydrophilicity has contributed to increased water flux during the colour removal process.

The MO adsorption on G-LDH and G-LDO were well simulated by Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity of G-LDO (q(max) = 1062.3 mg/g) was much higher than that of G-LDH (q(max) = 443.5 mg/g) at pH = 4.5.

Compared to HZSM-35 and H-Beta, HZSM-5 zeolite with middle pore caliber exhibited the highest selectivity to light olefins, and Agincorporation can further promoted selectivity to light olefins at a little cost of P/E (propylene to ethylene) ratio. Promotion of Ag-incorporation on light olefins formation was probably due to the active sites generated by silver species acting as dehydrogenation sites, and enhancing the cleavage of C-H bond.

This study investigated the effect of various inherent active constituents of four solid wastes (waste tire, cotton straw, Chinese medicinal residue and municipal solid waste) on the mercury removal performance of their derived chars. Modification methods (chemical impregnation and physical activation) were used to clarify modification influence on inherent active constituents and mercury removal performance of chars. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed decomposition technic (TPDT) and elemental mercury adsorption testing were used to measure and evaluate various chars. The results indicated that only waste tire generated mercury chemisorption sites (sulfide) during pyrolysis process. Sulfide could oxidize Hg-0 into HgS on char T6 derived from tire waste whereas sulfate could not on char derived from Chinese medicinal residue. The evaporation of element Cl during pyrolysis process led to the low adsorption capacity of municipal waste derived char. The modification methods impeded T6 mercury removal performance, but they promoted other three chars without chemisorption sites. The results provide meaningful guidance that the nature of raw materials should be taken into account during the preparation of mercury sorbents, and the preparation method should also vary for different raw materials.

However, because of the elastoplastic properties of steel bars, the post yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column can be very slight or even negative. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) can provide a high degree of ultimate strength, light weight, and protection from corrosion. By combining steel and FRP, a designable post-yield stiffness can be achieved for concrete structures reinforced with steel-FRP composite bars (SFCBs) or hybrid steel/FRP bars. This paper conducted cyclic loading tests on four concrete columns with different reinforcement types, including steel bars, hybrid steel/FRP bars, and SFCBs. The test results showed that (1) the columns reinforced with different bars had similar strain distributions from column base to cap prior to yielding. After yielding, the plastic deformation of the ordinary RC column concentrated at the column base and the loading capacity decreased with the increase of lateral drift because of the P-delta effect. (2) Unlike the negative post-yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column, the post-yield stiffness of a column with hybrid reinforcements was positive. As the post-yield stiffness ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement increased by 27 percent, the post-yield stiffness of the concrete column increased by 7.4 percent. Therefore, the corresponding displacement ductility could reach 11 much greater than that of the RC column (6.28). (3) As a result of the more robust hysteretic curve of the RC column, the equivalent viscous damping coefficients of the RC column were greater than those of the hybrid column, whereas the hybrid reinforced concrete columns could dissipate earthquake energy without a corresponding loss of strength.

The photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of gas-phase n-decane was studied using a micro-meso-structured-photoreactor irradiated by simulated solar light, consisting of chambers and channels mechanically engraved in an acrylic slab. The network of chambers and channels is sealed with a borosilicate slab, allowing a good light penetration through the entire reactor depth. A sheet of cellulose acetate (CA) coated, in one side, with TiO2-P25 was assembled between the two slabs, allowing high spatial illumination homogeneity over the catalyst surface. The P25 thin film was in contact with the air stream flowing in the network. The reactor contains 1.95 g of TiO2 in contact with the air stream per liter of reactor volume and the illuminated catalyst surface area, in contact with the gas phase, per reactor volume was calculated to be 349 m(2) m(-3), which is similar to 1.4 times higher than that obtained for an annular photoreactor packed with CA monolithic structures coated with TiO2-P25. The PCO reaction rate, r(dec), was assessed under different experimental conditions: amount of TiO2 supported in CA sheets, n-decane feed concentration, feed flow rate, relative humidity and UV irradiance. The highest r(dec) value (0.82 mu mol min(-1)) was achieved when the following conditions were employed: mTiO(2) = 75 mg, C-dec,C-feed = 131 x 10(-2) mol m(-3), Q(feed) = 220 cm(3) min(-1) and I = 38.4 W m(-2).

The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of T-leaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict T-leaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20-35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. T-leaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that T-leaf is best explained by air temperature (T-air) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in T-leaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteoro logical data are available.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate heterogeneous mercury oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface. The results indicate that Hg-0 is chemically adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 0 0) surface with an adsorption energy of -60.82 kJ/mol. HCl can decompose on MnFe2O4 surface to form active surface chlorine species for mercury oxidation. Both intermediate (HgCl) and final (HgCl2) products are adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 00) surface in a dissociative adsorption manner. Hg-0 oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism in which a bimolecular reaction occurs between adsorbed Hg and active surface chlorine species.

Commercialization of this process depends on the development of suitable membrane modules. The earlier studies were performed on flat sheet membranes. Hollow fiber modules seem to be the most suitable module for this process on account of high packing density for handling the large amount gasoline-stream in the refineries. In this study, a mathematical model is derived for determining the performance of axial flow type hollow fiber module. The experiment could not be performed on hollow fiber module due to unavailability of commercial modules. However, tubular modules are commercially available. Tubular and hollow fiber modules have similar geometry, and their mathematical models are also the same. Therefore, for the model validation, experiments are carried out on a commercially available tubular module for removal of thiophene from n-heptane/thiophene model gasoline. Furthermore, the experimental results from the literature for the ethanol/water separation are also used for model validation. The mathematical model is successfully validated in both cases. Since the performance of membrane modules also depends on different dimensional parameters related to module geometry, the performances of the hollow fiber module are determined by varying these parameters. Simulations show that lower membrane area, lower length/diameter ratio of module, higher module porosity and lower fiber radius leads to improvement in the module performances. Furthermore, the performance of module is compared for both co-current and counter-current flow arrangements, which shows that the values of average fluxes are higher for counter-current flow arrangement. These results suggest that for given conditions, counter-current hollow fiber module is a better option than the co-current hollow fiber module. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We speculated that the intensity that had positive (16 T) or negative (500 nT and 0.2 T) effects on osteoblast differentiation would inversely influence osteoclast differentiation. To answer this question, we examined the profound effects of SMFs on osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells.

A correct assessment of the equilibrium and kinetics of adsorption is extremely important for the design and operation of adsorption based processes. In our previous studies we focused on the evaluation of the equilibrium of CO2/CH4 adsorption on cherry stone-based carbons. In the present paper the kinetics of adsorption of CO2 on two cherry stone-based activated carbons (CS-H2O and CS-CO2), previously prepared in our laboratory, has been evaluated by means of transient breakthrough experiments at different CO2/CH4 feed concentrations, at atmospheric pressure and 30 degrees C. A commercial activated carbon, Calgon BPL, has also been evaluated for reference purposes. Three models have been applied to estimate the rate parameters during the adsorption of CO2 on these carbons, pseudo-first, pseudo-second and Avrami's fractional order kinetic models. Avrami's model accurately predicted the dynamic CO2 adsorption performance of the carbons for the different feed gas compositions. To further investigate the mechanism of CO2 adsorption on CS-H2O, CS-CO2 and Calgon BPL, intra-particle diffusion and Boyd's film-diffusion models were also evaluated. It was established that mass transfer during the adsorption of CO2 from CO2/CH4 is a diffusion-based process and that the main diffusion mechanisms involved are intra-particle and film diffusion. At the initial stages of adsorption, film diffusion resistance governed the adsorption rate, whereas intra-particle diffusion resistance was the predominant factor in the following stages of adsorption.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray elemental mapping, and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the composition and microstructures of Fe-0/OMt. Interestingly, nanoscale zero-valent iron (Fe-0) core with a uniform iron oxide shell are formed and well dispersed on the organo-montmorillonite supports. After systematical optimization of treatment conditions, Fe-0/OMt (0.1 g/L) with sparging O-3 (concentration of 4 mg/L) demonstrated excellent degradation efficiency for TBBPA and BPA (98.6% and 94.7%, respectively) with the initial concentration of 10 mg/L. Notably, in the aforementioned oxic conditions, bromide ions, ferrous ion, and hydroxyl radicals were detected during the progressive degradation of the TBBPA and BPA, suggesting that TBBPA was debrominated as the primary step then completely mineralized by oxidative process. Finally, combined with the analysis of degradation products identified by LC-MS, pathways of TBBPA and BPA over Fe-0/OMt were proposed. These results revealed that a Fe-0/OMt based on advanced oxidation technology is of great potential for remediating TBBPA and BPA in aqueous environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The impregnation process was optimized and a uniform distribution of TOPO was achieved within the membrane walls, when the membranes were treated with a carrier solution containing 600 mg/L TOPO, and air-dried for 30 min at a low air flow rate (Re-air = 9.2). The resulting extractant impregnated hollow fiber membranes (EIHFM) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, water entry pressure, gas permeability and mercury porosimetry analysis, all of which showed significant structural and morphological changes in the EIHFMs; pore size, porosity and tortuosity were estimated to be 0.5 mu m, 0.09 and 33, respectively. The EIHFMs exhibited high mass transfer rates and removal efficiency during simultaneous extraction and stripping of phenol. At an initial phenol concentration of 200 mg/L, 99% phenol was extracted from the wastewater within 7 h, whereas more than 91% phenol was recovered in the stripping solution, yielding a concentration factor of 1.79. The performance of the EIHFMs did not change significantly during consequent operations under identical conditions, indicating the stability of impregnation.

It is a very meaningful work to respectively separate a few trace phenolic compounds from their aqueous solution by foam fractionation. The studies of surface activity and surface excess revealed that catechol had a stronger competitive adsorption on the bubble surface than phenol by using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a collector. A two-stage batch foam fractionation technology was developed for the respective separation of catechol and phenol from their diluted aqueous solution. In the first stage batch foam fractionation, catechol was effectively separated with a high enrichment ratio of 32.2 and a high removal percentage of 90.25% while the removal percentage of phenol was only 2.32% under the suitable operating conditions. A high selectivity coefficient of catechol over phenol could reach 35.25. Then, phenol existed in the residual solution, which was used as the feeding solution in the second stage. In the second stage batch foam fractionation, the small bubbles were used to enhance the adsorption of phenol. At the same time, the foam fractionation column of an inclined foam phase was used to enhance foam drainage and then phenol was effectively removed with a high enrichment ratio of 44.4 and a high removal percentage of 90.23% under the suitable operating conditions.

Thus, the goal of this research is to improve fundamental understanding of rotary calcination to aid in the creation of a scientific methodology for process design and scale-up. For successful calcination to occur, the residence time of the particles must exceed the time required for heating and calcination at a set temperature. The optimal residence time therefore depends on both of these competing time scales, each of which is function of feed material properties, kiln geometry and kiln operating conditions. For uniform treatment of the feed, the particles must also exhibit low axial dispersion. In this work, the residence time distribution and axial dispersion coefficient for a dry cohesive fluid cracking catalyst powder were measured in a pilot plant kiln using a tracer study developed by Danckwerts. Results were successfully matched to the Taylor fit of the axial dispersion model and the Sullivan prediction for mean residence time. It was found that an increase in feed rate, kiln incline and rotary speed decreased mean residence time and overall axial dispersion. Such results have been established previously for free-flowing material like millimeter-sized extrudates, but have not been previously reported for the cohesive powders such as the one used in our work. As in free-flowing material, the axial dispersion coefficient was found to vary with kiln conditions. The values of the axial dispersion coefficients were lower for the powder than for free-flowing material, showing a dependency of axial dispersion on material properties as well as bulk flow behavior.",2019,157,16,ED7YG,2019/12/25

The filter was composed of a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) matrix infused with lithium ion sieves (LIS) H1.6Mn1.6O4. Characterization of the LIS/PAN NF confirmed its favorable structural and surface properties for effective Li+ adsorption. The LIS/PAN NF was mechanically suitable as a microfiltration membrane with high water flux and low pressure requirement. Breakthrough experiments at varied feed concentrations (C-f), seawater fiowrates (F), and NF thicknesses (Z) revealed the dynamic adsorption behavior of the filter. The seawater residence time was most critical and must be kept >= 0.12 min at any given C-f and Z to maximize the Li+ capacity of the filter. This can be conveniently achieved by adjusting the F of the process. Analogous to a packed bed system, the predictive power of nine breakthrough models were determined through non-linear regression analyses. Results reveal that bed-depth-space-time, Bohart-Adams (BA) and Thomas models adequately predicted the performance of the filter albeit BA exhibited the best agreement. Meanwhile, Wolborska failed to converge with any of the experimental results while Yoon-Nelson, Wang, Clark, dose-response, and modified dose response were too simple to provide any meaningful information.

However, biochar is less effective than activated carbon in immobilising contaminants. To increase the efficiency of contaminant binding by biochar, an alternative method of biochar activation that leads to an increase in surface area is proposed. Herein, we improve the biochar by subjection to a range of activation techniques using microwaves, carbon dioxide or superheated steam. To test their effectiveness, the untreated and activated biochars were added at 5% w/w into three different industrially contaminated soils sampled from areas around a coal plant (KOK and KB) and a bitumen processing plant (POPI). The surface area (SSA) of biochar subjected to the activation techniques increased significantly. The SSA of the original biochar was 11 m(2)/g, while those of the activated biochars was 443 m(2)/g (microwave), 512 m(2)/g (CO2) and 841 m(2)/g (superheated steam). The addition of activated biochar reduced the freely dissolved PAHs (C-free in the KOK and POPI soils by up to 86% (from 153 to 22 ng/L and from 172 to 24 ng/L, respectively) and in the KB soil by up to 70% (from 52 to 16 ng/L) compared to the untreated soils. Even more pronounced reductions were observed in the concentration of bioaccessible PAHs (C-bioacc). The activated biochars reduced C-bioacc in all soils by almost 100% (from 1.39 to 0.03 for KOK, from 1.92 to 0.01 for POPI and from 1.16 to 0.04 mg/kg for KB) compared with the untreated soil.

However, DEX radiolysis was restrained in the presence of NO3-, CO32-, 2-propanol and tert-butanol. DEX radiolytic degradation was in accordance with the pseudo first-order reaction kinetics. The rate constant ratios of OH, e(aq)(-) and H-center dot towards DEX degradation could be calculated as k(OH): k(eaq-): k(H) = 10:1.5:1. Besides, it is observed that radiolytic degradation of DEX restrained algae growth.

The PtOx formation is a slow process and stabilizes only after approximately four repeated driving cycles. The stabilized NO2 yield is 7-27% (relative) lower than with the reduced catalyst, depending mainly on the history of operating temperatures.

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

In the first scale, the mortar, consisting of sand, cement paste and a large number of small pores (10-600 mu m), is homogenised using analytical Mori-Tanaka method with constituents' moduli from micro-indentation. In the second, mu XCT images of a 20 mm cube are converted to mesoscale representative volume elements for finite element homogenisation, with fibres and a small number of large pores (>= 600 mu m) in the homogenised mortar. The resultant elastic moduli are compared favourably with experimental data. This approach accounts for a large number of pores with a wide size range yet without excessive computational cost. Effects of fibre volume fraction and orientation are investigated, demonstrating the approach's potential to optimise the material's micro-structure for desired properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of the elastoplastic properties of steel bars, the post yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column can be very slight or even negative. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) can provide a high degree of ultimate strength, light weight, and protection from corrosion. By combining steel and FRP, a designable post-yield stiffness can be achieved for concrete structures reinforced with steel-FRP composite bars (SFCBs) or hybrid steel/FRP bars. This paper conducted cyclic loading tests on four concrete columns with different reinforcement types, including steel bars, hybrid steel/FRP bars, and SFCBs. The test results showed that (1) the columns reinforced with different bars had similar strain distributions from column base to cap prior to yielding. After yielding, the plastic deformation of the ordinary RC column concentrated at the column base and the loading capacity decreased with the increase of lateral drift because of the P-delta effect. (2) Unlike the negative post-yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column, the post-yield stiffness of a column with hybrid reinforcements was positive. As the post-yield stiffness ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement increased by 27 percent, the post-yield stiffness of the concrete column increased by 7.4 percent. Therefore, the corresponding displacement ductility could reach 11 much greater than that of the RC column (6.28). (3) As a result of the more robust hysteretic curve of the RC column, the equivalent viscous damping coefficients of the RC column were greater than those of the hybrid column, whereas the hybrid reinforced concrete columns could dissipate earthquake energy without a corresponding loss of strength.

But the NOx reduction efficiency is highly inhibited by oxygen present in the flue gas. In this research, a rotary reactor was proposed for the treatment of NOx in oxygen-rich flue gases. In the proposed rotary reactor, an adsorption zone and a reduction zone were configured in such a way that the flue gas stream, containing NOx and oxygen, and the reducing gas stream, containing CO, are introduced into the reactor separately. Loaded catalysts were rotated between the two zones to adsorb NOx from the flue gas in the adsorption zone and then reduce the adsorbed NOx by CO in the reduction zone. The performance of the rotary reactor was investigated in a fixed bed reactor loaded with Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts synthesized in the lab, and the dynamic adsorption reduction process was simulated by switching the inlet gas stream. The results showed that the simulated rotary reactor could well remove and reduce NOx from oxygen containing flue gases. NOx removal efficiencies were very stable in the investigated temperature range, i.e., 250-400 degrees C. Higher CO concentration could significantly enhance both NOx removal and reduction efficiencies. The amount of CO slipping into the adsorption zone was very low even though CO is in great excess. In order to explore the reaction mechanism, in situ DRIFT study was performed. It was found that CO could occupy the active Fe sites, promoting NOx desorption and the subsequence NOx removal in the adsorption stage. But the active intermediates for NOx reduction is not effectively formed during CO purging, resulting in a lower NOx reduction efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To examine the hazard ratio of suicide according to the presence and the types of disability and identify patterns in the results. Methods: In this study, we used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data on 990,598 people, and performed analysis on the cause of death from 2003 through 2013. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of suicide associated with disability and its types. Results: The hazard ratio of suicide among people with disability was 1.9-folds higher compared to people without disability. The risk of suicide among different disability types was higher in mental disorder, renal failure, brain injury and physical disability. The hazard ratio of suicide in people with disability was not varied by income. The time to death by suicide for people with disability from the onset of their disability was 39.8 months on average. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that when the government plans suicide prevention policies, early and additional interventions specific to people with disability are needed. Disability due to mental disorder, renal failure should be given priority. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2023,45,9,EF3QT,2020/01/27

Via a convenient and hydrothermal method, large-sized GR nanosheets can serve as substrate for monodispersed dispersion of C3N4 nanosheets. A subsequent loading of very small amount of CDots (1 wt%, 2-5 nm) onto sheet-on-sheet heterostructure significantly enhance visible-light-driven photoredox performances of catalysts, including oxidation of organics pollutant (RhB, 96.0%) and reduction of heavy metals [Cr(VI), 83.6%]. Excellent catalytic properties of GR/C3N4/CDots heterostructure can be predominantly ascribed to the intimate interfacial contact among constructing ingredients, increased specific surface area and enhanced light adsorption derived from GR and CDots carbon materials. Particularly, the synergistic sheet-on-sheet interaction between C3N4 and carbon materials (GR and CDots) remarkably accelerate the electrons/holes separation, giving rise to significantly enhanced photoredox performances of GR/C3N4/CDots in comparison with other counterparts. The synergism effect between organic contaminants and heavy metals also contributed to the efficient performance of GR/C3N4/CDots, wherein the O2- and OH were the main active species in the photoredox reactions. This metals-free heterostructure shows favorable photostability in cyclic experiments. We anticipate that our work could provide a classical paradigm for rational design of efficient and visible-light-driven photocatalysts for their sustainable applications in wastewater treatment.

Three composites were prepared namely AC/Ce, AC/Fe, and AC/Ce/Fe. The composites were investigated for the simultaneous desulfurization of thiophene, benzothiophene (BT), and dibenzothiophene (DBT) in a model fuel. The surface structures, morphologies, and pore structures were characterized. The unloaded AC had the highest surface area and pore volume of 460.27 m(2)/g and 0.71 cm(3)/g respectively. Moreover, the unloaded AC showed the highest surface oxygen-containing groups but performed the least in desulfurization. The adsorptive desulfurization efficiency followed the order: AC < AC/Fe < AC/Ce < AC/Ce/Fe. The AC/Ce/Fe performed the best in the adsorption of thiophene (31%), BT (30%), and DBT (75%) despite having the least surface area and pore volume of 430.44 m(2)/g and 0.64 cm(3)/g. All the adsorbents showed a greater affinity to the large size DBT. Batch and column experiments carried out using AC/Ce/Fe revealed a high absorptive capacity and breakthrough for DBT i.e. 16 mg/g. The kinetic data showed a synergistic effect of surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion occurring concurrently, and the results complied with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption results are well fitted to the Freundlich isotherm indicating a heterogeneous adsorption process. Thermal regeneration experiments carried out on AC/Ce/Fe showed stable efficiency in the adsorptive desulfurization after regeneration cycles. The regeneration properties displayed by the adsorbent could enhance its practical application in an industrial setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,21,9,EA6LC,2018/01/09

Here we show that microsporidia carried by H. axyridis can kill A. bipunctata following the oral uptake of spores, suggesting that their horizontal transmission via intraguild predation may help the invader to outcompete its native competitor. The native seven-spotted ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata) is thought to be less susceptible both to the spread of H. axyridis and to its microsporidia. To investigate whether the distinct levels of pathogen susceptibility in these three ladybird species are determined by their immune systems, we compared the immunity-related transcriptomes of untreated beetles and beetles challenged with suspensions of bacteria and yeast. We found that H. axyridis carries three and four times as many genes encoding antimicrobial peptides representing the attacin, coleoptericin and defensin families than C. septempunctata and A. bipunctata, respectively. Gene expression studies following the injection of bacteria and yeasts into beetles revealed that members of these three antimicrobial peptide families are also induced more strongly in H. axyridis than C septempunctata or A. bipunctata. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that a superior immune system promotes the performance of invasive species. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Further, fabricating multifunctional superhydrophilic coatings using low-cost, nontoxic, environment friendly, and plentiful materials from biological resources is highly desirable. Herein, superhydrophilic coatings with a highly jagged surface morphology were synthesized based on the electrostatic-interaction- or hydrogen-bonding-based LbL assembly of the biotic materials chitosan (CHI) and rice husk ash (RHA) nanosilica, which are abundantly available in nature. The synthesized multilayered (CHI/RHA nanosilica)(n) films were highly transparent and resisted fogging, frosting, and biofouling. Specifically, given the water-absorbing capability of the films, they showed excellent antifogging and antifrosting properties even under aggressive fogging and frosting conditions. Further, the as-prepared superhydrophilic multilayered films, which had a rough surface structure at the micro- and nanoscale, showed potential in reducing the attachment of proteins and various microorganisms, significantly preventing the phenomenon of biofouling in stagnant liquids.

The OTMs were tested and evaluated under twenty consecutive methane reduction/air oxidation cycles. Several solid-state kinetic models were consecutively and optimally screened for each OTM at different redox cycles. The use of different supports resulted in different forms of the redox kinetics. NiO/Al2O3 and NiO/TiO2 reduction kinetics were rate-determined by chemical reaction and fitted via the Unreacted Shrinking Core Model. On the other hand, NiO/ZrO2 and NiO/SiO2 reduction was found to proceed via nucleation and subsequent nuclei growth and was suitably described with Avrami-Erofeev models. The use of different types of kinetic models is attributed to differences in strength of metal-support interactions. Specifically, the strong interaction between NiO and Al2O3 and TiO2 creates NM-support interfaces where Ni nuclei are formed very fast, rendering the chemical reaction the governing step of the reduction process. When NiO is supported on SiO2 and ZrO2, the interaction is weak and NiO basically behaves like free NiO, reducing via the slow formation of homogeneous nuclei on the surface and the subsequent faster growth of Ni domains. Regarding Ni oxidation kinetics, all OTMs were rate-determined by nucleation and nuclei growth. NiO/Al2O3 and NiO/TiO2 OTMs followed an Avrami-Erofeev model approach for all considered cycles, while NiO/ZrO2 oxidation kinetics were described via a Prout-Tompkins model that considered a short but still, significant nucleation period.

Although this process enables the engineering of complex fibrous structures; the inability to yield industrial scale production through existing ES techniques becomes a bottle-neck and critical feature. Furthermore, in several advanced engineering remits (such as healthcare) the role of fiber alignment, layering and morphology is also paramount. In this study the development of a enhanced spinneret device for the up-scaled production of aligned fibers is demonstrated. Compared to conventional centrifugal electrospinning (CES,) techniques, a relatively greater production rate of fibers is achieved at reduced rotation speeds and also excludes the use of needles during the process. The impact of experimental process parameters such as rotation speed (60-90 rpm), working distance (9-14 cm) and solution concentration (15-30 w/v%) on resulting fiber properties were investigated using commercial polymeric drug delivery excipient polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Mass production of fibers is demonstrated and the impact of specifically aligned ultrafine drug-fiber matrices on drug release behavior is shown. For this, the antibiotic tetracycline hydrogen chloride was spun alongside PVP (5 w/w%) as the matrix material. The spinneret device provides an enhanced approach for active embedded fiber production on a scale favorable to industry (120 g/h) when using optimized process parameters (70 rpm and 15 kV for the four-pore system). Furthermore, the in-situ method permits control on fiber alignment and overall mat thickness providing tailored fabrication for specific applications or drug dosage requirements (e.g. active dissolution behavior for fibrous drug delivery systems).

The composites were characterized by various techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurement through nitrogen adsorption at cryogenic temperature. Single component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were performed at different temperatures. The selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). MOF505@GO composites showed higher porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption compared to its parent compound MOF-505. MOF-505@5G0 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 3.94 mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa, having an increase of 37.3% in comparison with the parent MOF-505. The significant improvement of CO2 uptakes could be attributed to not only new micropores and unsaturated metal sites formed in the MOF505@GO, but also enhanced surface dispersive forces of the composites. The experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were well fitted with dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model. The CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 adsorption selectivities were up to 8.6 and 37.2 at 298 K and 100 kPa, respectively, predicted by LAST. More strikingly, the composites showed excellent moisture stability, which was confirmed by PXRD analysis. These superior performances suggested that the MOF-505@GO composites are promising candidates for industrial CO2 capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,69,16,ED2QD,2019/12/27

The as-synthesized G-LDH and G-LDO were applied as adsorbents to remove methyl orange (MO) from aqueous solutions at different experimental conditions, and the results showed that the interaction of MO with G-LDH and G-LDO were strongly pH-dependent and ionic strength-independent. Kinetic study indicated the MO adsorption on G-LDH and G-LDO were well simulated by pseudo-second-order model. The MO adsorption on G-LDH and G-LDO were well simulated by Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity of G-LDO (q(max) = 1062.3 mg/g) was much higher than that of G-LDH (q(max) = 443.5 mg/g) at pH = 4.5. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from temperature-dependent isotherms indicated that the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermal process. The FT-IR and XRD analysis further evidenced that the interaction of MO with G-LDH was mainly dominated by electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, hydrogen bonding and surface complexation, whereas the uptake of MO to G-LDO was mainly attributed to electrostatic interaction and surface complexation. These results suggested that the G-LDO was a promising material for the efficient removal of organic pollutants in real environmental pollution cleanup. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A significant CO2 capacity improvement of up to 36% was achieved. It was found that higher CO2 uptakes were related to removal of inorganic impurities i.e. mineral matter and increase of the submicropores volume i.e. smaller than 0.8 nm. Sorbents were thoroughly characterized in terms of texture and chemical composition. CO2 uptake was determined by BET isotherm measurement carried out at 273 K and pressure of up to 0.95 bar. The enhancement of CO2 uptake was observed especially for ACs with the highest initial mineral matter content. It was found that mineral matter in ACs plays the role of a ballast and additionally blocks adsorption places and submicropores volume thus lowers CO2 uptake. On the other hand it was proven that mineral matter may prevent the structure from collapsing and thus can stabilize high SSA. The AC surface oxidation effect on CO2 uptake was determined by comparison of ACs treated with HCI and HNO3. Both acids remove mineral matter content to the same degree, but detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study revealed that in case of HNO3 treatment, AC surface was more oxidized which correlated with higher CO2 uptake.

The prodrug approach has been, and is being, employed to overcome such barriers for some drug molecules, utilizing a chemical modification approach rather than a formulation-based approach. A prodrug strategy involves modification of the active moiety into various derivatives in a fashion that imparts some advantage, such as membrane permeability, site specificity, transporter targeting and improved aqueous solubility, over the parent compound. Areas covered: The following review is a comprehensive summary of various novel methodologies and strategies reported over the past few years in the area of ocular drug delivery. Some of the strategies discussed involve polymer and lipid conjugation with the drug moiety to impart hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, or to target nutrient transporters by conjugation with transporter-specific moieties and retrometabolic drug design. Expert opinion: The application of prodrug strategies provides an option for enhancing drug penetration into the ocular tissues, and overall ocular bioavailability, with minimum disruption of the ocular diffusion barriers.

Given that the MICA is an unsupervised modeling method, a direct rational study that can conclusively demonstrate which non-quadratic function is optimal for the general purpose of fault detection is inaccessible.

Recognition of this issue and motivated by the superiority of ensemble learning strategy, a novel ensemble MICA (EMICA) modeling approach is presented for enhancing non-Gaussian process monitoring performance. Instead of focusing on a single non-quadratic function, the proposed method combines multiple base MICA models derived from different non-quadratic functions into an ensemble one, and the Bayesian inference is employed as a decision fusion method to form a unique monitoring index for fault detection.

To develop a competitive and commercially viable technology, better mercury capture and regeneration performances of regenerable sorbents are required. For this purpose, non-thermal plasma was used to treat the magnetic sorbents FeMnOx synthesized by co-precipitation. The mercury adsorption tests showed that the treated sorbents with non-thermal plasma had higher mercury removal efficiency than raw sorbents, and longer treatment time resulted in higher efficiency. The main reason was that the content of the high valence manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were greatly increased by non thermal plasma treatment, and this played a significant role in the mercury removal process. Further analysis showed that the lattice oxygen coming from the stepwise reduction of manganese oxide (MnO2 -> Mn2O3 -> MnO) served as an oxidant in the reaction with Hg degrees. The NO, SO2 and H2O inhibited the mercury adsorption while O-2 and HCl promoted mercury removal. High valence of manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were consumed during mercury adsorption, while non-thermal plasma treatment could replenish it and increase mercury removal regeneration performance better than without non thermal plasma treatment. In summary, the combination of magnetic separation, thermal regeneration and plasma treatment makes FeMnOx an excellent recyclable sorbent for mercury emission control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This algorithm improves the trajectory-tracking performance of the hydraulic servomechanism (HSM). To reduce the difficulty in directly utilizing the AIMC for the HSM position trajectory, the complex electro-hydraulic mechanical system was divided into two subsystems: nonaffine nonlinear, and linear. The AIMC controller was designed for the nonaffine nonlinear subsystem to realize velocity trajectory tracking control, whereas a position feedback control was derived for the linear subsystem.

By establishing a suitable internal hydrodynamic circulation in a membrane bioreactor, granular sludge (GS) was successfully cultivated into mature granules with a compact structure and clear shape, in which extracellular polymeric substances played an important role in maintaining its integrity. The results showed that the main factors to determine the cultivation of GS included the total retention of sludge by the membrane module, the internal hydrodynamic circulation, and the entanglement of filamentous bacteria to sludge particles. Filamentous bacteria initiated a granulation process under the action of internal circulation, and maintained the stability of GS for a long period by wrapping biomass aggregates together. Even though filamentous bacteria were the major dominant microbial species in the bioreactor, the microbial community was richly biodiverse, and was responsible for the removal of organic pollutants and nutrients.

Desorption of the SO2 chemisorbed at temperatures in the range of 150-300 degrees C produces carbon gasification, forming oxygen surface groups that decompose mainly as CO at higher temperatures (>-500 degrees C).

The paper investigates differences in engagement with medical research between White British and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups in the UK, using data from the Wellcome Trust Monitor (WTM).Design. The study used two waves of the WTM (n=2575) to examine associations between ethnic group and participation in medical research, and willingness to participate (WP) in medical research. Logistic regression models controlled for socio-economic and demographic factors, and relevant outlooks and experiences that are assumed to be markers of engagement.Results. Respondents from the BAME group were less likely to have participated in medical research compared to those from the White British group, but there was only patchy evidence of small ethnic group differences in WP. Influences on engagement with medical research varied somewhat between the White British and BAME groups, in particular in relation to occupation, education, health, attitudes to medical science and belief.Conclusions. These findings consolidate previously context-specific evidence of BAME group under-representation in the UK, and highlight heterogeneity in that group. Efforts to address the under-representation of those from BAME groups might benefit from targeted strategies for recruitment and advocacy, although improved data sets are required to fully understand ethnic differences in engagement with medical research.",2019,158,11,EE5HL,2018/09/11

Health care, education, employment, independent living, and community engagement have been identified as areas of concern. However, relatively little research has been done to understand the experiences, perceptions, and needs of individuals with cerebral palsy as they transition toward adulthood. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the transition experiences, perceptions, and needs of young adults with cerebral palsy living in one state in the southeastern United States. Methods: Focus groups with nine young adults with cerebral palsy (19-34 years) were conducted. The focus group interview explored the preparation for transition and experiences navigating adulthood. The audio-recorded groups were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Young adults with cerebral palsy identified numerous challenges associated with navigating adulthood. The main themes were: 1) being thrust into adulthood; 2) navigating systems and services; 3) understanding and managing my body; and 4) dealing with stereotypes and prejudice. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to transition with a focus on building capacity and empowerment. To navigate complex systems of care, ""navigators"" or ""facilitators"" are needed. Additionally, practitioners and service providers in adult systems need further education about cerebral palsy.

Endotrophin, the C-terminal fragment of the alpha 3 chain of procollagen type VI (also called Pro-C6), is involved in both adipose tissue matrix remodelling and metabolic control. We established a serum assay for endotrophin to assess if this novel adipokine could identify type 2 diabetic patients who respond optimally to PPAR gamma agonists, improving the risk-to-benefit ratio. The BALLET trial (NCT00515632) compared the glucose-lowering effects and safety of the partial PPAR gamma agonist balaglitazone with those of pioglitazone in individuals with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin therapy. The per protocol population (n = 297) was stratified into tertiles based on baseline endotrophin levels. Participants were followed-up after 26 weeks, after which correlational analysis was carried out between endotrophin levels and measures of glucose control. This is a secondary post hoc analysis. Endotrophin was significantly associated with therapeutic response to balaglitazone and pioglitazone. At week 26, only individuals in the upper two tertiles showed significant reductions in HbA(1c) and fasting serum glucose compared with baseline. The OR for a 1% and a 0.5% reduction in HbA(1c) for individuals in the upper two tertiles were 3.83 (95% CI 1.62, 9.04) p < 0.01, and 3.85 (95% CI 1.94, 7.61) p < 0.001, respectively. Endotrophin levels correlated with adipose tissue mass, insulin resistance and fatty liver index. Notably, PPAR gamma-associated adverse effects, such as moderate-to-severe lower extremity oedema, only occurred in the lower tertile. Elevated endotrophin serum levels predict response to two insulin sensitisers and reduce the risk of associated adverse effects, thereby, identifying patients with type 2 diabetes who may profit from PPAR gamma agonist treatment.",2022,76,3,EF3RE,2019/10/12

In this study, we identified 14-3-3 zeta protein (Aj14-3-3 zeta) as a novel target of miR-137 using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and transcriptome screening. Expression analysis indicated that consistently depressed expression profiles of miR-137 and Aj14-3-3 zeta were detected in both LPS-exposed primary coelomocytes and Vibrio splendidus-challenged sea cucumbers, suggesting a positive regulatory interaction. Consistently, miR-137 overexpression or inhibition in vitro and in vivo showed no effect on Aj14-3-3 zeta mRNA levels, but the concentration of Aj14-3-3 zeta protein was induced or repressed, respectively. Moreover, siRNA-mediated Aj14-3-3 zeta knockdown in vivo decreased both mRNA and protein. expression levels of Aj14-3-3 zeta and significantly promoted coelomocyte apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometry, consistent with miR-137 inhibition.

Membrane technology has been widely applied for their extraction, including hollow fiber supported liquid membranes. However, their application to saline waters is limited. In this work, a hollow fiber liquid micro-extraction (HFLPME) system, with a configuration of 2 phase solvent bar micro-extraction (2SBME), using the ionic liquid N-methyl-N,N,N-trioctylammonium chloride (Aliquat (R) 336), dissolved in kerosene as extractant is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing HFLPME of Ag and Cd in saline waters. The use of an ionic liquid solution in the 2SBME leaded to higher stability of the organic solution in the fiber. The effect of chemical variables on the extraction was evaluated. Extraction of Cd and Ag with Aliquat (R) 336 was enhanced by Cl- in the sample, but it was independent of the concentration of organic matter. Extraction yield varied in the range 65-80% for Ag, and 45-95% for Cd, depending on the salinity of samples. The highest extraction was obtained in seawater samples for 75% Aliquat (R) 336 dissolved in kerosene with 18% dodecan-1-ol, after 45 min, and 800 rpm stirring rate in the sample. Efficacy of the proposed system when applied to real samples was 88.10 +/- 4.14% for Cd, and 61.47 +/- 3.00% for Ag in seawater, and 92.73 +/- 5.37% for Cd and 64.23 +/- 2.85% for Ag in a hyper-saline lagoon (70 g L-1 NaCl). In conclusion, the proposed methodology allowed a miniaturization of Ag and Cd extraction in short times, requiring lower amount of reagents and solvents, less energy as well as reducing operational cost and wastes if compared with existing liquid membrane based methods.

It is found that the unsteady term (including density ratio) has the most effect on the unsteady drag coefficient and Weber number secondly. The viscosity ratio has little effect on the unsteady drag coefficient due to low Ohnesorge number. The numerical results confirm that the difference between drag coefficient and standard steady drag coefficient has an approximately linear curve fit with the unsteady parameter for low Weber number.

In the present work, we have characterized gas-liquid flow in a pseudo 2D bubble column for a wide range of superficial gas velocities (U-G = 1-30 cm.s(-1)) that cover dilute to dense flow conditions. In-house developed voidage probes were used to measure local gas volume fraction fluctuations, which in turn were used to characterize dynamics of column-scale re-circulatory flow and bubble-scale flow processes, under dilute-to-dense conditions. Importantly, the spatial distribution of internal composition of gas volume fraction, i.e. gas volume fraction contained in different bubble size groups, was measured. Further, the spatial distribution of chord length and bubble size was measured for a wide range of U-G. With increase in U-G, the low frequency oscillations caused by meandering bubble plume at lower U-G were found to diminish and the fluctuations caused by bubble swarms were found to dominate under the dense flow conditions. Using the time spent by the probe in each bubble, the bubble population was classified into different size groups and the gas volume fraction for each size group was measured. Under dense flow conditions, small bubbles were seen to accumulate near column walls, as exhibited by wall peaking in gas volume fraction profiles and that large bubbles were found to flow through the column centre. The results presented in this work are important to improve the understanding of dense gas-liquid flow and also for rigorous validation of CFD models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we improve the biochar by subjection to a range of activation techniques using microwaves, carbon dioxide or superheated steam. To test their effectiveness, the untreated and activated biochars were added at 5% w/w into three different industrially contaminated soils sampled from areas around a coal plant (KOK and KB) and a bitumen processing plant (POPI). The surface area (SSA) of biochar subjected to the activation techniques increased significantly. The SSA of the original biochar was 11 m(2)/g, while those of the activated biochars was 443 m(2)/g (microwave), 512 m(2)/g (CO2) and 841 m(2)/g (superheated steam). The addition of activated biochar reduced the freely dissolved PAHs (C-free in the KOK and POPI soils by up to 86% (from 153 to 22 ng/L and from 172 to 24 ng/L, respectively) and in the KB soil by up to 70% (from 52 to 16 ng/L) compared to the untreated soils.

The design and engineering of these smart materials was achieved through the coupling of pDA-modified SiO2 surfaces with poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based SCH-imprinted layers that can change their physical conformation in response to heat. The TO-MIPs were finally synthesized by being coupled with Au nanoparticles (the sensitive light-heat converter) through an in situ reduction of metallic salts.

To determine why LPS O-antigen-deficient bacteria are less able to colonize the host midgut, we examined in vitro survival rates of three LPS O-antigen deficient Burkholderia mutants and lysates of five different midgut regions. The LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants were highly susceptible when cultured with the lysate of a specific first midgut region (M1), indicating that the M1 lysate contains unidentified substance(s) capable of killing LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants. We identified a 17 kDa protein from the M1 lysate, which was enriched in the active fractions. The N-terminal sequence of the protein was determined to be a soybean Ktinitz-type trypsin inhibitor. These data suggest that the 17 kDa protein, which was originated from a main soybean source of the R. pedestris host, has antibacterial activity against the LPS O-antigen deficient (rough-type) Burkholderia.

The influence of contact time, solution pH, ionic strength, initial adsorbate concentration and desorption studies was investigated. The experimental data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm (R-2 = 0.997), yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 36.25 mg/g. The kinetic data indicated that MB adsorption onto ALiCE can be represented by the pseudo second-order-model with intraparticle processes initially controlling the process of MB adsorption. Overall, these results indicate that the novel ALiCE offers great potential for removing cationic organic pollutants from rivers and streams. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We found CS-Ag3PO4 significantly promoted the MO degradation under artificial sunlight irradiation. The visible-light photocatalytic activity was maximized at the dose of 5 mg/L CS-Ag3PO4, which obviously maintained the high activity even after five cycles. The remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic activity could be mainly attributed to the slow recombination between photo-induced carriers and the strong visible-light absorption ability.

The obtained nanoflowers with magnetic core and flower-like organosilica shell possess radial-wrinkle, tunable perpendicular channels, and high magnetization (62 emu/g). The nanoflowers were employed as support for Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) covalent immobilization. The maximum amount of CALB immobilized on the nanoflowers was 93 mg/g(support), while the specific hydrolytic activity was 22,700 U/g(support). Meanwhile, the CALB@nanoflowers showed better pH stability than free CALB and CALB@MMPS, which can remain 65% of initial activity after incubated in cyclohexane at 60 degrees C for 96 h, and remain 90% of initial activity after stored in room temperature for 42 days. In addition, the CALB@nanoflowers could catalyze the synthesis of alkyl levulinates through the esterification of levulinic acid alcohols with different chain length (n-butyl alcohol, n-caprylic alcohol, n-lauryl alcohol) in a solvent-free system effectively. After recycling 10 times, the CALB@nanoflowers retained more than 85% of its initial activity in catalyzing the synthesis of butyl-levulinates and more than 96% of the initial activity in catalyzing the synthesis of long chain alkyl levulinates, which was much higher than commercial N435. With these desired characteristics, the design of hydrophobic nanoflowers with tunable wrinkle channels for lipases immobilization opens up a new way to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the lipases, and may have potential applications in various lipase-based industrial processes.

Sewage sludge was first torrefied in an auger reactor under two different conditions: temperature of 250 degrees C and 275 degrees C and average solid residence times of 13 min and 24 min, respectively. Pyrolysis was conducted at 530 degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor. The catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors was carried out in a fixed bed reactor using gamma-alumina (gamma-Al2O3) as a catalyst. The experimental results showed that the combination of the torrefaction pre-treatment with the catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors did not noticeably improved the properties of the liquid organic phases for use as a fuel, in terms of O/C molar ratio and nitrogen content, compared to pyrolysis of sewage sludge with the same catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors but without the torrefaction pre-treatment. Generally, the torrefaction did not have effect on the type of chemical families identified in the liquid phases and had little effect on the proportion of these families. The advantages of the combination of treatments were, on the one hand, the catalyst saving resulting from the lower amount of vapors generated by the pyrolysis of torrefied sewage sludge and, on the other hand, the slight decrease in the coke yield.

Various immune signaling pathways and effectors have been shown to mediate a certain degree of defense specificity against different Plasmodium species. A key pattern recognition receptor of the Anopheles gambiae immune system is the fibrinogen domain-containing immunolectin FBN9, which has been shown to be transcriptonally induced by Plasmodium infection, and to mediate defense against both rodent and human malaria parasites and bacteria. Here we have further studied the defense specificity of FBN9 using a transgenic approach, in which FBN9 is overexpressed in the fat body tissue after a blood meal through a vitellogenin promoter. Interestingly, the Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes showed increased resistance only to the rodent parasite P. berghei, and not to the human parasite P. falciparum, pointing to differences in the mosquito's defense mechanisms against the two parasite species. The Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes were also more resistant to infection with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and showed increased longevity when infected with P. berghei.

We sought to document pathways between under/unemployment and health among racialized immigrant women in Toronto while exploring the ways in which gender, class, migration and racialization, as interlocking systems of social relations, structure these relationships.Design. We conducted 30 interviews with racialized immigrant women who were struggling to get stable employment that matched their education and/or experience. Participants were recruited through flyers, partner agencies and peer researcher networks. Most interviews (21) were conducted in a language other than English. Interviews were transcribed, translated as appropriate and analyzed using NVivo software. The project followed a community-based participatory action research model.Results. Under/unemployment negatively impacted the physical and mental health of participants and their families. It did so directly, for example through social isolation, as well as indirectly through representation in poor quality jobs. Under/unemployment additionally led to the intensification of job search strategies and of the household/caregiving workload which also negatively impacted health. Health problems, in turn, contributed to pushing participants into long-term substandard employment trajectories. Participants' experiences were heavily structured by their social location as low income racialized immigrant women.Conclusions. Our study provides needed qualitative evidence on the gendered and racialized dimensions of under/unemployment, and adverse health impacts resulting from this.

We found that the European Common Frog Rana temporaria expresses a protein in its skin that is evolutionarily related to the host-defense protein S100A7. This prompted us to test if the encoded protein, which is an important microbicidal protein in human skin, shows similar activity in frogs. The R. temporaria protein lacks the zinc-binding sites that are key to the antimicrobial activity of human S100A7 at neutral pH.

The main parameters considered in the study are the replacement ratio of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) and the content of the basalt fibre. The research work is focused on the influences of the above parameters on the failure mode, compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and the ultimate strain of the BF reinforced RAC. The results show that the mechanical properties of RAC can be enhanced by using BF. The SEM observations of the concrete reveal that the BF accumulated in pores and on the surface of the attached mortar can not only strengthen the RAC, but also improve the microstructure of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), which further enhances the strength and ductility of the RAC.

The influence of solvent effects during structural tuning, purity, morphology, optical, absorption, structural phase transition and stoichiometric formation of the prepared Lead Magnesium Titanate perovskites has been discussed in detail. A remarkable observation is that the thin microbelts structured PMT perovskite (PMTT) exhibited an excellent water splitting performance and it is more sensitive to the illuminated visible light. Owing to the unique structural features, the photoconversion efficiency value of PMTT perovskite is similar to 3.9, 3.54, 2.85 and 1.52 times higher than those of other prepared PMT perovskites including pristine PbTiO3. The excellent water splitting performance of PMTT (thin microbelts) may be ascribed to the remarkable structural features that include a large surface area, high optical absorbance, more active sites and high interface area of the microbelts, which provide large contact areas between the electrolyte and highly active materials for electrolyte diffusion and a rapid route for charge transfer with minimal diffusion resistance. In addition, each thin microbelt is directly in contact with the Ni foam substrate, which can also shorten the diffusion path for the electrons.

The significant shift in the equilibrium line of the CH4 + neohexane (2,2-dimethylbutane, NH) hydrates replaced with CO2 (10%) + N-2 (90%) and CO2 (20%) + N-2 (80%) indicates that CH4 molecules in the sH hydrates were significantly exchanged with flue gas mixtures. Furthermore, C-13 NMR spectroscopy revealed that replacement using flue gas occurs without a structural transition, and that CO2 molecules preferentially attack CH4 molecules occupied in the medium 4(3)5(6)6(3) cages of sH hydrates. The extent of the CH4 + NH - flue gas replacement was approximately 74%. During CH4 - flue gas replacement in sH hydrates, there was no significant change in heat flow associated with the dissociation and subsequent reformation of gas hydrates. Dissociation enthalpies of gas hydrates before and after replacement, measured using a high-pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter (HP mu-DSC), also supported isostructural replacement with the high extent of reaction.

Such hybrids are introduced into polymer nanospheres prepared by extended Stoller strategy, followed by calcination and template removal to fabricate NiO/MCNs. The typical NiO/MCNs have spherical morphology (similar to 280 nm in diameter), uniform mesopores (5.9 nm), high specific surface area (714 m(2) g(-1)), and well-dispersed NiO nanoparticles (7.20 wt.%). Package mesoporosity among the carbon spheres reduces ion diffusion distance, and the mesopores benefit fast ion transportation. Besides, the introduction of NiO nanoparticles not only provides pseudocapacitance, but also increases the graphitization degree of the carbons and improves crystalline structure. As a result, NiO/MCNs as supercapacitor electrodes show a high specific capacitance of 406 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and it still maintains 315 F g(-1) at a high loading current density of 20.0 A g(-1). Besides, NiO/MCN electrode retains 91.0% of the original capacity at 3.0 A g(-1) after 10,000 cycles, exhibiting outstanding cycle stability. The easy prepared, well-structured, and high-performance NiO/MCNs provide great potential to support advanced energy storage systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of spine! Co3O4 was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, meanwhile the replication of ordered mesoporous structure was evidenced by low-angle X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption/desorption and transmission electron microscopy images. Among three different Co3O4 catalysts tested, Co3O4-KITE displayed the best catalytic activity in PMS solution, achieving almost complete removal of 30 mu M chloramphenicol within 60 min at the reaction conditions of 0.1 g L-1 catalyst and 1.0 mM peroxymonosulfate. The superior catalytic performance of Co3O4-KIT6 was ascribed to the combination of multiple unique characteristics, including the large specific surface area, high pore volume, high Co2+ content and high density of surface active sites. Several factors played important roles in controlling the degradation of chloramphenicol. Higher catalyst dosage, higher PMS concentration, neutral pH and higher reaction temperature favored the removal. The balance among Co2+/Co3+, O2-/O-2 and PMS decomposed in solution ensured the continuous generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals, and the latter made the predominant contribution for the CAP degradation. Considering its outstanding catalytic activity, excellent reusability and long-term stability, ordered mesoporous Co3O4 should be an ideal catalyst for environmental application.

However, a number of discrepancies can be found in the past literature about the reaction mechanism and the kinetic behaviour of the system. In the present investigation, by running the reaction in a batch system under homogenous conditions, a radical mechanism was ruled out and experimental evidence of an ionic reaction network was provided. No induction period was found possibly due to a low amount of nitrous acid produced by dissociation of concentrated nitric acid. The reaction rate is significantly increased by the addition of sulfuric acid. A mathematical model is proposed based on benzyl nitrite as the key intermediate which is in equilibrium with benzyl alcohol and irreversibly decomposes with a significant yield of benzaldehyde. The model is capable to predict the behaviour of the reacting homogeneous phase system at varying initial conditions. The estimated kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are reported. The kinetic modelling carried out in this work would also be relevant to run the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in other reactor schemes, such as continuous flow (micro) reactors.

They can be both obtained by direct nitration of benzaldehyde in mixed acid. The meta substituted isomer is the main reaction product even though it has been recently pointed out that the yields of the two compounds (ortho and meta isomers) are affected by the mixed acid composition. In this work, a reaction network consisting of equilibrium and irreversible reactions and a mathematical model are proposed. For each of the reactions the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were estimated in order to explain and predict the changes in the reactivity and selectivity at varying conditions. Moreover, a simplified approach was successfully used to describe the kinetics of the secondary oxidation pathways of the organics in the nitrating mixtures leading to benzoic and nitrobenzoic acids. The parameter estimation suggested that the ortho-oriented nitration is mainly due to the rearrangement of the complex of benzaldehyde with the nitronium ion rather than to the direct nitration of the organic substrate. On the other hand, the nitration of benzaldehyde and of the complex are both relevant for the meta-oriented isomer formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018,60,13,EF1JQ,2018/02/07

In this study, the complete coding sequence of four g-type lysozymes were identified in Ciona intestinalis. Phylogenetic analysis and modelling supported the hypothesis of a close relationship with the vertebrate g-type lysozymes suggesting that the C intestinalis g-type lysozyme genes (CiLys-g1, CiLys-g2, CiLys-g3, CiLys-g4) share a common ancestor in the chordate lineage. Protein motif searches indicated that C intestinalis g-type lysozymes contain a GEWL domain with a GXXQ signature, typical of goose lysozymes. Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis results showed that transcripts are expressed in various tissues from C intestinalis. In order to determine the involvement of C intestinalis g-type lysozymes in immunity, their expression was analyzed in the pharynx, showing that transcripts were significantly up-regulated in response to a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data support the view that CiLys g-type are molecules with potential for immune defense system against bacterial infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

000if,"Mok, CC",Co-morbidity in psoriasis: mechanisms and implications for treatment,English,Review,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality and it is a major clinical problem. A common therapy for ARDS patients is mechanical ventilation (MV). However, poorly applied MV can be potentially fatal and optimal MV settings are patient specific. Thus, choosing a good positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)-level compromise is a clinical challenge. Physiological modeling of the lung is one way to support the selection of the optimal settings for mechanical ventilation. This research makes the reasonably well-supported assumption that optimal PEEP is in the region of minimal elastance of the lung-tissue. The first order model of pulmonary mechanics (FOM) was modified in two differing ways in order to determine the patient-specific pressure range that coincides with minimal elastance. The extensions to the FOM (multiplicative elastance correction and additive volume correction parameters) are compared and evaluated. The addition of the correction parameters ultimately improved the consistency of the modeled elastance across PEEP levels for most patients tested. The results for minimal elastance were in very similar ranges for both approaches. Although this consistency offers a partial validation of the robustness of the approaches, discernment of the optimal approach cannot be determined. Further validation across differing patient states and experimental inputs must be undertaken to determine which method is more representative of true patient physiology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to overcome the drawbacks of high energy consumption and severe environmental pollution in conventional treatments, a novel electrochemical advanced oxidation process was first reported for the V2O3 oxidative extraction in alkaline media. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified electrode was employed to produce hydrogen peroxide via two-electron-pathway oxygen reduction reaction, following by the Cr(III)-induced activation process to generate highly oxidative (OH)-O-center dot radical. The oxidative dissolution ratio was affected by the alkaline concentration, and the V(III) was completely transferred within 160 min treatment at the pH of 13. Subsequently, the vanadium and chromium were selectively recovered by a solvent extraction method. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy and quenching reagents were performed to probe the reaction mechanism and main reactive species, indicating that the heterogeneous electro-catalytic oxidative dissolution process was mainly attributed to the in-situ generated (OH)-O-center dot. Furthermore, the long-term stability test illustrates the excellent durability of the MWCNTs modified electrode. Therefore, this novel method offers a promising solid waste treatment approach, and new insight on the electrochemical advanced oxidation process in alkaline media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The adsorption data in the absence and presence of Ca2+ satisfactorily fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The phosphate adsorption in the absence of Ca2+ showed little pH dependence in the range of 4-6, but it decreased sharply with the pH increase at pH above 6. The phosphate adsorption in the presence of Ca2+ showed little pH dependence in the range of 4-9. The mechanism for phosphate adsorption onto HZO mainly followed the inner-sphere complexing mechanism, and the surface chloride and hydroxyl groups played the key role in the phosphate adsorption. The presence of Ca2+ significantly enhanced the adsorption of phosphate on HZO over a pH range of 6-9, and the formation of Ca2+-phosphate species in the phosphate/calcium solution such as CaHPO40 and the formation of phosphate-bridged ternary complexes ( Zr-P-Ca) on the HZO surface played the key role in the enhancement of phosphate adsorption by coexisting Ca2+.

Methods: Doppler ultrasonography of lower limbs was performed pre- and postoperatively to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis in 150 patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Plasma d-dimer levels were assessed 2 days before surgery and on the 3rd, 7th, and 10th days after surgery. Statistical analysis was carried out to define a feasible threshold for the d-dimer levels. Results: Plasma d-dimer levels were found to be systematically raised postoperatively, and they differed between patients with and without VTE significantly. On the third day after surgery, d-dimer levels of more than 3 mg/L indicated VTE with a sensitivity of 88.37% and a specificity of 96.96%, allowing for the definition of a feasible cutoff value. Duration of surgery, duration of tourniquet, ventilation time, and time of postoperative immobility of lower limbs were identified as highly significant risk factors for the development of VTE. Conclusion: Using a threshold of 3 mg/L, the d-dimer levels will screen out VTE with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in younger patients who have undergone ORIF for lower limb fractures.",2021,12,10,EE4QX,2018/06/24

The MgCO3 crystals were broken into small pieces and homogenously dispersed in polymer matrices via mechanical stirring to form MMMs. In particular, an amphiphilic comb polymer (CP) composed of poly(ethylene glycol) behenyl ether methacrylate (PEGBEM) and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM), i.e., PEGBEM-POEM, was found to be an effective matrix due to the specific interactions between its carbonyl oxygen atoms and MgCO3. The detailed interactions, morphologies, and structures of MgCO3 and CP/MgCO3 hybrids were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopies. The CP/MgCO3 MMM with 45 wt% MgCO3 exhibited the highest CO2/N-2 selectivity of 93.8 and CO2 permeance of 30.9 GPU (1 GPU = 10(-6) cm(3) (STP)/(s center dot cm(2)center dot cmHg)). This performance surpasses other MgCO3 MMMs prepared using commercially available polymers such as PEBAX (R) (a polyether block amide) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).

We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between the ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and dynamics. We build on previous studies to highlight the role of viscosity contrast in determining the morphology of mantle plumes and provide detailed visualizations and quantitative information on the convection phenomenon. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection regimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and plate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume structures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the perfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is systematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the bottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure. As the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is observed from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes, accompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing. In the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into intermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume hot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (1/300), the regime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we observe for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with cellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes. We use experimental data to quantify these morphological changes and mixing dynamics of the plumes at different regimes of U.

The coupling of the two processes can take place inside a single apparatus or using separate units. If a single apparatus is utilized, the coupling is more direct, but separate units offer higher degrees of freedom for the design with more opportunities to optimize the system without constraints. However, when using separate units, the integration of the two unit operations depends largely on the parameters intervening in the coupling procedure. These parameters are the recycle ratio, R, if a recycle stream is used to backmix part of the exiting stream, or the number, N, of blocks if the volume of the reaction and the membrane area are fractionated into multiple reaction-separation blocks. The possibility of different combinations of these two basic methods is also presented. The case study to illustrate the effect of the various parameters (R, N, the Damkohler number and the Peclet number) and to find the proper operating conditions is the photocatalytic green synthesis of an aromatic aldehyde, which is recovered from the reaction solution by a pervaporation process to avoid further oxidation.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces. It might be of interest to explore the transfer of colloids along or inside real surfaces (being a mosaic of nano-or micro-scale domaines with specific interactions).",2019,157,9,ED4OG,2019/05/12

Here, we found that Cxcl18b is chemotactic towards neutrophils, similarly to Cxcl8a/Interleukin-8, the best characterised neutrophil chemoattractant in humans and teleosts. Like Cxcl8a, Cxcl18b-dependent recruitment required the chemokine receptor Cxcr2, while it was unaffected by depletion of the other two neutrophil receptors cxcrl and cxcr4b. To visualise cxcl18b induction, we generated a Tg(cxcl18b:eGFP) reporter line. The transgene is induced locally upon bacterial infection with the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum, but strikingly is not directly expressed by infected cells. Instead, cxcl18b is induced by non-phagocytic uninfected cells that compose the stroma of the granulomas, typical inflammatory lesions formed upon mycobacterial infections.

This is compared with the conventional batch extraction in parallel. Continuous operation of a process involving liquid liquid extraction and then two-phase separation is achieved instantly. For the latter a micro-scale separator is used. Compared with batch extraction, the segmented micro-flow extraction process shows order-of-magnitude faster extraction times, higher extraction ability for Co, lower extraction for Ni, and then a better selectivity between Co and Ni at industrial-matching concentration. Regular columnar slugs are observed at low flow rates and found to be a Gaussian function of the flow rates. Matched in and outlet flows indicates that extraction in micro-flow is dependent on mass transfer by molecular diffusion. Extraction efficiency is enhanced by the internal circulation flow generated within slugs.

The HCHO degradation rate is enhanced with all the silicate-TiO2 composites with respect to that of the benchmark TiO2. The incorporation of titania into the silicate matrix favors the gas phase removal of HCHO in the following sequence: MTi > KTi > STi > BTi > TiO2. The exposed fraction of titania particles and the size of the TiO2 anatase crystalline domains determine the efficiency of the hybrid material, which is optimized in high-aluminum kaolinite and mordenite based hybrids.

The present study is focused on the comparison of solar and UV photo-Fenton technologies (by using H2O2 or S2O82-), for the removal of five micro-contaminants (antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) from-simulated freshwater at very low concentrations (100 ppb each one).

We showed that carp Il10 is able to downregulate proinflammatory activities by carp phagocytes and promote B cell proliferation, differentiation and antibody production as well as proliferation of memory T cells. Taking advantage of the recent annotation of the carp genome, we completed the sequence of a second il10 paralogue, named il10b, the presence of which was expected owing to the recent (8 million years ago) fourth round of whole genome duplication that occurred in common carp. In the present study we closely compared the two Il10 paralogues and show that Il10a and Il10b have almost identical gene structure, synteny, protein sequence as well as bioactivity on phagocytes. Although the two il10 paralogues show a large overlap in tissue expression, il10b has a low constitutive expression and is highly upregulated upon infection, whereas il10a is higher expressed under basal conditions but its gene expression remains constant during viral and parasitic infections. This differential regulation is most likely due to the observed differences in their promoter regions. Altogether our results demonstrate that gene duplication in carp, although recent, led to sub-functionalization and expression divergence rather than functional redundancy of the Il10 paralqgues, yet with very similar protein sequences.

A fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) performing denitrification via thiosulfate (S2O32-) oxidation of a nitrate-contaminated synthetic wastewater was first operated under decreasing feed pH values from 7.00 to 5.25. Denitrification efficiency > 99% was observed even at feed and effluent pH of 5.75 and 5.30, respectively. At lower feed pH values, the denitrification efficiency decreased rapidly due to inorganic carbon deficiency. The addition of a carbonation unit continuously feeding anaerobic grade CO2 to the FBR biofilm allowed to investigate denitrification at pH values lower than 5.0. This new configuration, i.e. FBR with a carbonation unit, was able to sustain a complete and stable denitrification even at pH as low as 4.75. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed the evolution of the denitrifying biofilm during the FBR operation, resulting in a robust and high-performing mixotrophic consortium of chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria dominated by T. denitrificans. Batch activity tests performed at three different stages of the FBR operation (feed pH 7.0, 6.0 and 5.25) showed that low pH cultivation enhanced the denitrification activity (mg N/g VS d) of the FBR biofilm at acidic pH values.

The aim of the study was to investigate disorders of the coagulation system in patients with chronic hepatitis C having different extent of hepatic fibrosis well defined by liver histology. A total of 62 patients with chronic hepatitis C were recruited and categorized into 2 groups according to their histological fibrosis stage : mild/moderate fibrosis group (F0-F3 group, n = 30) and extensive fibrosis/cirrhosis group (F4-F6 group, n = 32). The control group consisted of 31 healthy individuals.

The PC level exhibited a significant reduction in both patient groups when compared to the normal control group (89.25% +/- 10.05% and 48.33% +/- 15.86% vs 111.86 +/- 10.90; P < .001 and P < .001).

Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that AT (P = .003) and PC (P = .0001) were the most important factors associated with advanced fibrosis. The PC (P = .001) was found to be the only predictor of mild fibrosis. In conclusion, PC deficiency occurs in an early stage of liver fibrosis.

Recently cleaved transferrin products was shown to activate macrophages in vitro. We now use an in vivo model of self-resolving peritonitis in goldfish, coupled with gene expression and protein analysis to evaluate the contributions of cleaved transferrin to acute inflammation. We show, for the first time, that cleaved transferrin products are produced in vivo early during an acute inflammatory response. These cleaved transfetrin fragments were produced during pathogen-induced, but not sterile, inflammation. Both macrophages and neutrophils were able to contribute to transferrin cleavage. However, only macrophages contributed to this innate process through inducible expression of transferrin. The appearance of transferrin cleavage products in vivo correlated with the influx of leukocytes but did not necessarily correlate the induction of robust respiratory burst and nitric oxide responses. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of work highlighting the role of transferrin as an immune regulator during acute inflammation. Given the significant conservation of this and related molecules, these findings have potentially broad implications for host defences and inflammation control across evolution.

Herein, a novel two-step strategy has been built to prepare new KF (KF-PDA-GO) with remarkably improved integrated performances by forming polydopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) bi-layer coatings on the surfaces of KFs. Orthogonal tests based on three factors and three levels were designed and carried out to systematically study the influences of dopamine (DA) concentration, GO concentration and reaction temperature on the structure and performances of KF-PDA-GO fibers. Results show that the reaction temperature is the decisive factor for both surface active and UV resistance. All KF-PDA-GO fibers not only have greatly improved surface activity and UV resistance, overcoming the two intractable disadvantages of KFs, but also show outstanding thermal resistance and higher tensile properties including tensile strength, modulus, elongation and break energy. For the new fiber (KF-PDA-GO3) prepared with the optimum conditions, its surface free energy increases 54%, meanwhile the retention of tensile strength after 168 h-UV irradiation is as high as 93.4%, almost the best value among the latest modified KF fibers reported. Different failure modes are found between original and modified KF fibers through intensively discussing the morphological and chemical structures of fibers. This investigation provides a novel and facile method to develop new KF fibers with higher integrated performances, especially outstanding surface activity, UV resistance, thermal and mechanical properties.

The numerical model is validated using experimental results from the breakage of blackboard chalk sticks subject to uniaxial compression in a cylindrical container. The validated model is used to investigate particle breakage when agitated by rotating blades, which is encountered in a range of pharmaceutical processes, such as agitated filter drying, rotary tablet press feeding, and powder blending. The simulation results show that the breakage rate, that is the rate of particle size reduction (or the rate of fragment mass increase), increases as the applied pressure, impeller rotational speed, particle-particle friction, or particle-equipment friction increases. However, the extent of breakage per impeller revolution is independent of impeller rotational speed.

Changes in solution pH were used to decouple the effects of NOM on adsorption and major oxidative mechanisms, e.g., reactions on the surface of the photocatalytic spheres via positive hole (h(+)) mediation as well as in the solution via hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) reaction. At pH 3, highly electrostatic attraction between solutes (2,4-D and NOM) and photocatalyst surface caused increasing adsorption and consequently photocatalytic oxidation which mostly occurred via charge transfer on the surface of the spheres. At pH 7, on the other hand, electrostatic repulsion between solutes and photocatalyst surface reduced the adsorption and the process was primarily driven by hydroxyl radical attacks. With the aid of methanol as an (OH)-O-center dot scavenger, it was determined that at neutral pH, due to higher aromatic moieties concentration and lower NOM adsorption, the effect of NOM on scavenging (OH)-O-center dot was considerable. This effect dramatically decreased at low pH due to high adsorption of NOM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,12,6,EE5GQ,2018/09/15

However, its prevalence among people with disabilities in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) is unknown. Objectives: The objectives were to: (1) examine the prevalence of the homebound status among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs, and (2) identify its clinical, functional, and environmental determinants. Methods: This study included 221 community-dwelling subjects, aged >= 50 years, who applied for long-term care services at the Office for Legal Certification of Long-term Care Need of Coruna (Spain). Each subject had a disability in ADLs and was interviewed by a trained examiner in the subject's home. The participants were considered homebound if they remained inside their home during the previous week. Measures: Demographic, clinical, functional, and environmental factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with homebound status. Results: The prevalence of homebound status was 39.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of architectural bathers at the home entrance (stairs [OR: 6.67, p < 0.001] or a heavy door [OR: 2.83, p = 0.023]), walking ability limitations (OR: 3.26, p = 0.006), and higher age (OR: 1.05, p = 0.04) were associated with homebound status. Conclusions: Homebound status is a highly prevalent problem among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs. Architectural factors in the home and walking ability limitations seem to be important predictors, suggesting that health care interventions should target home adaptations and mobility skills as a means to preventing or decreasing homebound status.

The average COD removal efficiency at this loading rate was 96.7%. With increasing the inlet TPH concentration from 1 to 2.5 g/L, the biomass bacterial activity as dehydrogenase activity (DHA) increased from 7.5 to 27.1 mu g TF/g(biomass) d and remained almost unchanged with further increase of TPH concentration. The peroxidase activity (PA) remained high between 382 and 410 U/g(biomass). In addition, the complete removal of 1 TPH (88.7% COD removal) was observed at HRT of as small as 4 h (corresponding to the loading rate of 6 kg TPH/m3.d) under optimum H202/TPH mass ratio.

In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics of ESBL among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing lAls and their pattern of antimicrobial resistance, which can provide useful information about the epidemiology and risk factors associated with these infections. Materials and methods: One hundred sixty-seven E.co li and 47 K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strains causing IAIs were collected from 9 hospitals in China, during 2012 and 2013. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of these strains was determined. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to identify genes for beta-lactamase (bIaTEM, b1aSHV, blaOXA-1-like, and blaCTX-M). The isolates were also analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In 167 ESBL-producing E. coli strains, 104 strains (623%) were positive for CTX-M, and 9 strains (5.39%) were positive for SHV. Among the 47 K. pneumoniae strains, 35 strains (74.5%) were positive for SHV-2a, 12 strains (25.5%) were positive for CTX-M. No TEM-type and OXA-1-like strain was detected among all the ESBL-producing strains. Regarding the CTX-M-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, CFX-M-15 was the most common genotype in E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, accounting for 28.7% and 17.0%, respectively, followed by CTX-M-55 accounting for 16.2% and 2.13%, respectively; the remaining genotypes included CTX-M-123 and CTX-M-82. PFGE showed that E.coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strains causing lAls were diverse and that emerging resistance may not be due to the dissemination of national clones. Conclusion: The present study revealed that in ESBL-producing strains causing IAIs in China, the most common genotype for E.coli was CTX-M-15 and for K. pneumoniae was SHV-2a. However, there was a wide diversity of strains causing 'Ms among the ESBL-producing E. coll. and K. pneumoniae. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2022,668,12,EF9OP,2019/09/20

Herein, a novel two-step strategy has been built to prepare new KF (KF-PDA-GO) with remarkably improved integrated performances by forming polydopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) bi-layer coatings on the surfaces of KFs. Orthogonal tests based on three factors and three levels were designed and carried out to systematically study the influences of dopamine (DA) concentration, GO concentration and reaction temperature on the structure and performances of KF-PDA-GO fibers. Results show that the reaction temperature is the decisive factor for both surface active and UV resistance.

The bacterial cell envelope of in vitro cultured and in vivo Burkholderia differed in structure, as in vivo bacteria lacked lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. The LPS O-antigen deficient bacteria had a reduced colonization rate in the host midgut compared with that of the wild-type Burkholderia. To determine why LPS O-antigen-deficient bacteria are less able to colonize the host midgut, we examined in vitro survival rates of three LPS O-antigen deficient Burkholderia mutants and lysates of five different midgut regions. The LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants were highly susceptible when cultured with the lysate of a specific first midgut region (M1), indicating that the M1 lysate contains unidentified substance(s) capable of killing LPS O-antigen-deficient mutants.

The ceramic membrane allows for a separate feed of the reactants, therefore addressing the PO selectivity issue related to the propylene hydrogenation. The reaction is operated in a continuous methanol flow fed with propylene inside the tubular membrane; hydrogen and oxygen are fed through the porous, material. We observe that the feeding strategy of the reactants has an important effect on key parameters such as PO selectivity and productivity. By separating propylene from hydrogen, the propane formation was reduced with respect to conventional packed bed reactors. Moreover, the addition of small amounts of NaBr to the reaction medium increases the catalytic activity to PO, but also to propane formation. Therefore, this study provides a good starting point in the design of a membrane reactor device for the direct synthesis of PO where the main limitations such as propylene hydrogenation and water formation can be addressed.

The novel preparation method employed in this study successfully produced activated lignin-chitosan pellets. Structural and morphological characterizations were performed using BET, FTIR and SEM-EDX analyses. The influence of contact time, solution pH, ionic strength, initial adsorbate concentration and desorption studies was investigated. The experimental data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm (R-2 = 0.997), yielding a maximum adsorption capacity of 36.25 mg/g. The kinetic data indicated that MB adsorption onto ALiCE can be represented by the pseudo second-order-model with intraparticle processes initially controlling the process of MB adsorption. Overall, these results indicate that the novel ALiCE offers great potential for removing cationic organic pollutants from rivers and streams. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines ethnic disparities in prenatal care utilization by comparing two groups of ethnic minority and majority women.Design. We examine the roots of ethnic disparity in prenatal care utilization, focusing on how education and media exposure change health behaviours and lessen disparities. We rely on the 2002 Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey to draw our sample, predictors and the three dimensions of prenatal care, including timing of onset, frequency of visits, and type of provider.Results. Results from multinomial-, and binary-logistic regression provide evidence that ethnic minority women are less likely to obtain frequent prenatal care and seek care from professional providers than their majority counterparts. However, we find that ethnic minority women are more likely to obtain early care compared to ethnic majority women. Results for predicted probabilities suggest that education and media exposure positively influenced prenatal care behaviours with higher level of education and media exposure associating with accelerated probability of meeting prenatal care requirements.Conclusion.

This study investigated the effect of various inherent active constituents of four solid wastes (waste tire, cotton straw, Chinese medicinal residue and municipal solid waste) on the mercury removal performance of their derived chars. Modification methods (chemical impregnation and physical activation) were used to clarify modification influence on inherent active constituents and mercury removal performance of chars. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed decomposition technic (TPDT) and elemental mercury adsorption testing were used to measure and evaluate various chars. The results indicated that only waste tire generated mercury chemisorption sites (sulfide) during pyrolysis process. Sulfide could oxidize Hg-0 into HgS on char T6 derived from tire waste whereas sulfate could not on char derived from Chinese medicinal residue. The evaporation of element Cl during pyrolysis process led to the low adsorption capacity of municipal waste derived char. The modification methods impeded T6 mercury removal performance, but they promoted other three chars without chemisorption sites. The results provide meaningful guidance that the nature of raw materials should be taken into account during the preparation of mercury sorbents, and the preparation method should also vary for different raw materials.

In addition, organic substance consumption decreased with the increase of applied current. The concentration of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), an indicator of cell rupture, increased by 3.59 times at 2.5 mA; that of ATP, an indicator of cell metabolism, sharply decreased under 2.5 and 3.5 mA.

Theories that allow for estimating the adhesion force, or the force to separate surfaces from contact, with simple, single-equation theories (i.e., by considering roughness asperities as submerged-spheres) can be easily instituted in discrete element method simulations of many-particle systems, but require inputs that rely on quantification of the surface roughness. In this work, Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) topographical surface maps reveal that two scales of roughness characterize the surfaces of particles examined, similar to prior studies. Previously, the separation of the two roughness scales and determination of the associated wavelength, which are necessary for predicting adhesion forces, relied on visual selection. Here, an objective methodology to separate the scales of surface roughness and calculate the wavelength of each scale is established. Two artifacts are identified when using the new methodology that negatively impact adhesion force predictions if not eliminated, namely the Gibbs artifact and an ""atomic-scale-noise"" artifact. Procedures to overcome these artifacts are developed. The resulting surface roughness characterizations are employed in a new theory, the predictions of which are in excellent agreement with AFM pull-off force measurements.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces. It might be of interest to explore the transfer of colloids along or inside real surfaces (being a mosaic of nano-or micro-scale domaines with specific interactions).",2022,22,10,EF1KB,2019/07/12

In this study, we report that zebrafish STAT6 is induced during SVCV infection and reduces IFN phi 1 expression by suppressing TBK1 phosphorylation. A typical IFN stimulatory response element (ISRE) motif was found in the promoter region of zebrafish STAT6, and zebrafish STAT6 transcription was significantly upregulated in the early stages of virus infection. Overexpression of STAT6 interfered with IFN phi 1 promoter activity in response to SVCV infection. Additionally, TBK1-, but not MITA-mediated activation of the IFN phi 1 promoter was impaired by STAT6. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments indicated that MITA and IRF3 were significantly phosphorylated by TBK1, and that the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 was critical in this process. In the final step, STAT6 interacted with the N-terminal kinase domain of TBK1 causing dephosphorylation, which resulted in reductions in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the production of IFN phi 1.

The photo-Fenton process is efficient in persistent organic pollutant degradation and the use of low cost reactors with variable light path length such as raceway pond reactors (RPR) has been recently proposed. The aim of the study was to develop a simplified kinetic model predicting micropollutant removal rate as a function of environmental variables (irradiance and temperature), geometrical variables (light path length) and operating variables (reactant concentration). The parameters were obtained by fitting the model to 36 experimental conditions in 1.25-L cylindrical reactors at lab scale and then validated in a 360-L RPR at pilot plant scale. In the studied range, 10-40 degrees C, temperature enhances the photo-Fenton reaction rate by: i) accelerating the oxidation of ferrous iron with hydrogen peroxide (thermal Fenton); and ii) making the light absorption coefficient of ferric iron higher, that is the VRPA. The proposed photo-Fenton model takes into account both effects and properly fit experimental data.

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

The electrolyte reaches the substrate only after 2000 h of immersion without wetting completely the coating/substrate interface. Coatings have resisted 3000 h of salt fog test. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulation results indicate that the unsteady drag coefficient is always larger than the steady standard drag coefficient for the present decelerating relative flow. The effects of Weber number, density ratio and viscosity ratio on the unsteady drag coefficient of drop deformation are studied. It is found that the unsteady term (including density ratio) has the most effect on the unsteady drag coefficient and Weber number secondly. The viscosity ratio has little effect on the unsteady drag coefficient due to low Ohnesorge number. The numerical results confirm that the difference between drag coefficient and standard steady drag coefficient has an approximately linear curve fit with the unsteady parameter for low Weber number. These results will lay the foundation for the modeling of unsteady drag coefficient in our further work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,60,9,ED4OG,2018/07/22

Part 2: Three-way catalyst considerations,English,Letter,"Planarian, a representative of platyhelminthes, has strong regeneration ability and less complicated innate immune system. However, planarian immune system remains poorly understood. In this paper, a novel C-type lectin-like protein, namely, DjCTL was identified and characterized in Dugesia japonica. DjCTL was mainly expressed in the pharyngeal and epidermis and up-regulated upon the induction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria indicating that DjCTL may be involved in the immune responses. Recombination DjCTL protein agglomerated rabbit red blood cells and interacted with LPS, PGN, mannose and galactose as well as both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but it can only cause the agglutination of Gram-negative bacteria. Importantly, in the early periods of regeneration, DjCTL had a significantly high expression and was mainly expressed in early blastemas. RNA interference of DjCTL by dsRNA-DjCTL led to a slow wound healing during regeneration. These findings suggest that DjCTL participates in the innate immune response and plays an important role in early stages of regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among Medicaid-enrolled women using medical record review for all women receiving the etonogestrel implant between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2014. We compared the percentage of women with the implant removed at 6 and 12 months as well as reasons for early removal, for inpatient postpartum implant insertions vs. delayed postpartum or interval outpatient implant insertions. Results: A total of 4% of women (34/776 insertions) had documented implant removal within 6 months post-insertion, with no difference between postpartum inpatient and outpatient (delayed postpartum or interval). A total of 12% (62/518 insertions) of women had documented implant removal within 12 months. A lower percentage of women with postpartum inpatient insertions had the implant removed at 12 months post-insertion, compared to outpatient insertions (7% vs. 14%, p=.04). After controlling for age, parity, race and body mass index, women with postpartum inpatient insertions were less likely to have the implant removed within 12 months (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.97). The most commonly stated reason for removal was abnormal uterine bleeding, regardless of insertion timing.

Moreover, the NNV load was not the highest in dead grouper brains, suggesting that this load in the brain was not the key factor for the death of groupers. However, the brains of dead fish showed the highest expression of the interleukin (IL)-1 beta gene, a neurotoxic factor in the brain.

Using hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a structure-directing agent, the lamellar gamma-AlOOH with porous architectures was successfully prepared via a hydrothermal route. The hierarchical Al2O3 clusters, as the inorganic phase of resin composites, retain the unique structure of lamellar gamma-AlOOH by calcination treatment. In order to enhance the hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of Al2O3 clusters, silane coupling agent (A151) was used to modify the surface of Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation. The surface modified Al2O3 clusters exhibit excellent hydrophobicity, oleophilicity and chemical stability, owing to the tight binding of the hydrophobic functional groups on the inorganic Al2O3 clusters and the inherent stability.of the grafted hydrophobic molecule chains. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites were synthesized by suspension polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) and methacrylic acid butyl ester (MBA) on the surface modified Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation in the presence of coupling agents. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites can effectively separate oils and organic solvents with high oil absorption rate and high oil retention capacity. Moreover, the obtained resin composites have high oil uptake capacities due to the synergy absorption of porous Al2O3 clusters and acrylic resin. These excellent performances, such as excellent oil recoverability, excellent recyclability and high oil retention capacities, endow the material to be an ideal candidate to separate a variety of organic liquids from water.

Methods: In the study, we tested genomic variations in lncRNA-metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) loci, and their potentially functional correlationship with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) susceptibility based on a case-control study with a total of 587 PAH patients and 736 healthy controls in southern Chinese. Results: We found that the rs619586A > G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was significantly associated with PAH risk. The carriers with G variant genotypes had a decreased risk of PAH (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-0.90, p = 0.007) compared to the rs619586AA genotype. Further functional experiments indicated that the alteration from rs619586A to G in MALAT1 could directly upregulate X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) expression via functioning as the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-214, and consequentially inhibiting the vascular endothelial cells proliferation and migration in vitro by shortening S-M phase transition.

However, because of the elastoplastic properties of steel bars, the post yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column can be very slight or even negative. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) can provide a high degree of ultimate strength, light weight, and protection from corrosion. By combining steel and FRP, a designable post-yield stiffness can be achieved for concrete structures reinforced with steel-FRP composite bars (SFCBs) or hybrid steel/FRP bars. This paper conducted cyclic loading tests on four concrete columns with different reinforcement types, including steel bars, hybrid steel/FRP bars, and SFCBs. The test results showed that (1) the columns reinforced with different bars had similar strain distributions from column base to cap prior to yielding. After yielding, the plastic deformation of the ordinary RC column concentrated at the column base and the loading capacity decreased with the increase of lateral drift because of the P-delta effect. (2) Unlike the negative post-yield stiffness of an ordinary RC column, the post-yield stiffness of a column with hybrid reinforcements was positive. As the post-yield stiffness ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement increased by 27 percent, the post-yield stiffness of the concrete column increased by 7.4 percent. Therefore, the corresponding displacement ductility could reach 11 much greater than that of the RC column (6.28). (3) As a result of the more robust hysteretic curve of the RC column, the equivalent viscous damping coefficients of the RC column were greater than those of the hybrid column, whereas the hybrid reinforced concrete columns could dissipate earthquake energy without a corresponding loss of strength.

The galvanic corrosion of a high voltage conductor assembly consisting of a cylindrical CFRP rod surrounded by tightly wound aluminum wires has been investigated through experimental work and modeling. The main corrosion product is Al(OH)(3), which presents as a gelatinous substance in the crevices between the Al wires. The formation of Al(OH)(3) was observed to coincide with the decay in the galvanic corrosion current. A new analytical model was developed to investigate if the decay could be caused by corrosion products restricting the transport of oxygen to the cathode. Modeling of the oxygen diffusion through the deposited corrosion products generated galvanic corrosion rates that agreed well with the experimental measurements after an early exponential decay period. The findings suggest that the corrosion product deposition may be the most important galvanic corrosion rate controlling mechanism in this geometry and similar geometries.

Intensive research efforts have been undertaken in order to find effective methods to treat these compounds. In this study, the removal of four ECs including Bisphenol A (BPA), Estrone (E1), Sulfamethazine (SM2), Triclocarban (TCC) was investigated in the microbial fuel cell (MFC)-Fenton system. Glucose and graphite rod with stacked graphite granules were used as the substrate and electrode, respectively since they improved current density of MFC5 system and increased cathodic H2O2 synthesis. Both batch and continuous flow modes of MFCs were compared and the operational parameters for higher H2O2 yield were also studied. The results showed that for both batch and continuous flow modes, initially the H2O2 production had a rising trend and arrived at the highest level but subsequently it decreased. We later demonstrated that controlling pH at 3 would promote H2O2 accumulation. Integrating the in-situ H(2)O(2)synthesis and Fe2+ addition in the cathodic chamber, production of hydroxyl radicals was evidenced through salicylic acid degradation and formation of its hydroxyl products. The MFC-Fenton system could effectively remove El, BPA, TCC and SM2. Our results showed that the removal of ECs was attributed to the oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot and the adsorption on graphite materials. The contribution of the two removal mechanisms to the overall removal will vary with different ECs depending on the ECs reactivity in Fenton reaction. This study demonstrates the application of the MFC-Fenton technology to effectively remove El, BPA, TCC and SM2, which provides a promising and cost-effective alternative for future ECs removal.

The bacterial cell envelope of in vitro cultured and in vivo Burkholderia differed in structure, as in vivo bacteria lacked lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. The LPS O-antigen deficient bacteria had a reduced colonization rate in the host midgut compared with that of the wild-type Burkholderia. To determine why LPS O-antigen-deficient bacteria are less able to colonize the host midgut, we examined in vitro survival rates of three LPS O-antigen deficient Burkholderia mutants and lysates of five different midgut regions.

Multiple alignment analysis shows that the putative amino acid sequence of Sp-TRAf6 has highest identity of 88% with Pt-TRAF6 from Portunus trituberculatus, while the similarity of Sp-TRAF6 with other crustacean sequences was 54-55%. RT-PCR analysis indicated that Sp-TRAF6 transcripts were predominantly expressed in the hepatopancreas and stomach, whereas it was barely detected in the heart and hemocytes in our study. Moreover, Sp-TRAF6 transcripts were significantly up regulated after Vibrio parahemolyticus and LPS challenges. RNA interference assay was carried out used by siRNA to investigate the genes expression patterns regulated by Sp-TRAF6. The qRT-PCR results showed that silencing Sp-TRAF6 gene could inhibit SpALF1, SpALF2, SpALF5 and SpALF6 expression in hemocytes, while inhibit SpALF1, SpALF3, SpALF4, SpALF5 and SpALF6 expression in hepatopancreas. Taken together, the acute-phase response to immune challenges and the inhibition of SpALEs gene expression indicate that Sp-TRAF6 plays an important role in host defense against pathogen invasions via regulation of ALF gene expression in S. paramamosain.

In the presence of Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires, bromate was reduced to Br- efficiently with the generation of HOBr intermediates. Bromide species analyses and nanowires characterizations indicated that surface bound ferrous ions of core-shell Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires could effectively promote the BrO3- removal. Meanwhile, molecular oxygen competed electrons from both Fe2+ and Fe-0 to generate reactive oxygen species of O-center dot(2)-, H2O2, and OH during the bromate removal process. Among the generated reactive oxygen species, O-center dot(2)- and H2O2 favored of bromate removal, but 'OH inhibited. We proposed a bromate removal mechanism with core-shell Fe@Fe2O3 nanowires, which suggested that the effect of surface bound Fe (II) and molecular oxygen was taken into consideration when using nZVI for bromate remediation in waters.

As immune system modulators, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) garnered initial enthusiasm from pre-clinical and epidemiologic studies as agents to reduce the risk of AD. Areas covered: This article will examine the evidence for the use of NSAIDs in AD by discussing the proposed mechanism of action, results from epidemiologic studies, and data from randomized controlled trials. In addition, a survey of several novel approaches to targeting inflammatory pathways currently in pre-clinical and clinical phases of development is presented. These agents primarily act to modulate microglial functioning, enhance amyloid-beta phagocytosis, suppress potentially harmful proinflammatory responses, or enhance systemic immunity. Expert commentary: While long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced incidence of AD in epidemiologic studies, randomized controlled trials have not replicated these findings. Thus, NSAID use cannot currently be recommended either for primary prevention or treatment of AD. However, the available evidence does suggest that cognitively normal patients taking long-term courses of NSAIDs for other indications likely have a decreased risk of AD, which represents an important finding given the high prevalence of NSAID use among older adults.",2021,45,9,EF1GS,2018/10/09

Results show that pH plays an important role in the formation of passive films on steel rebars. In non carbonated cement extract solution, corrosion behaviors of CS and Cr modified steel vary slightly, and Cr addition brings down the amount of defects in passive film. In carbonated cement extract solution, pitting potential shifts negatively as pH value decreases. Polarization resistance declines and the density of the current carrier in the passive film increases. With Cr content increasing, corrosion current density declines; pitting potential, polarization resistance and passivation range are magnified. Besides, the effect of Cr is more significant in lower pH. The good-to-poor sequence of corrosion resistance is: 5Cr > 3Cr > 1.5Cr > CS, and 5Cr steel possesses the best corrosion resistance.

These set of extracted DNA samples had already tested positive for Pneumocystis and patients had been classified in probable and unlikely PCP in a previous study. To evaluate de accuracy of the DHPS mutant's identification, an ""in house"" PCR and sequencing was performed. The sensitivity and specificity of PneumoGenius (R) PCR in discriminating between probable and unlikely Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) were 70% and 82% respectively. PneumoGenius (R) PCR was able to genotype more samples than ""in house"" DHPS PCR and sequencing.

This study focusses on the kinetics of the production of gamma-alerolactone from three different esters of levulinic acid using Ru supported on activated carbon as hydrogenation catalyst. Methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl levulinates are used as substrates. The transformation of these alkyl levulinates proceeds through a hydrogenation of the substrate to the intermediate gamma-hydroxy valeriate followed by lactonization to form gamma-valerolactone. Alkyl levulinates with shorter alkyl residue show an accelerated formation of gamma-valerolactone. Nevertheless, an efficient transformation of all alkyl levulinates into gamma-valerolactone is possible. The kinetic study indicates that at all reaction temperatures, lactonization occurs slower than hydrogenation and presents the rate-determining step. Analysis of the kinetic data shows the activation energies of hydrogenation and lactonization increase in the following order: methly levulinate < ethyl levulinate < butyl levulinate. Furthermore, activation energies for the hydrogenation and lactonization steps of the studied alkyl levulinates are in the range of 41-58 kJ mol(-1) and 50-63 kJ mol(-1), respectively, emphasizing the potential of alkyl levulinates as promising intermediates for.valerolactone formation.",2018,22,9,EE5HL,2018/09/16

The sulfated polyelectrolyte complex membranes (SPECMs) were first prepared by solution-casting and glutaraldehyde crosslinking process, and their structural characteristics and surface properties were systematically investigated. Intrinsic aggregation structure combined with numerous sulfate groups attenuates packing density of polymeric chains and promotes hydrophilicity, endowing SPECMs with high flux and perm-selectivity. SPECMs achieved a water permeability of 6.71 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), which was similar to 2.3 times higher than pristine sulfated chitosan membrane.

To develop a competitive and commercially viable technology, better mercury capture and regeneration performances of regenerable sorbents are required. For this purpose, non-thermal plasma was used to treat the magnetic sorbents FeMnOx synthesized by co-precipitation. The mercury adsorption tests showed that the treated sorbents with non-thermal plasma had higher mercury removal efficiency than raw sorbents, and longer treatment time resulted in higher efficiency. The main reason was that the content of the high valence manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were greatly increased by non thermal plasma treatment, and this played a significant role in the mercury removal process. Further analysis showed that the lattice oxygen coming from the stepwise reduction of manganese oxide (MnO2 -> Mn2O3 -> MnO) served as an oxidant in the reaction with Hg degrees. The NO, SO2 and H2O inhibited the mercury adsorption while O-2 and HCl promoted mercury removal. High valence of manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were consumed during mercury adsorption, while non-thermal plasma treatment could replenish it and increase mercury removal regeneration performance better than without non thermal plasma treatment. In summary, the combination of magnetic separation, thermal regeneration and plasma treatment makes FeMnOx an excellent recyclable sorbent for mercury emission control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main characteristics of the effluents produced in this soil remediation technology as well as the efficiency of the treatment (US, photolysis and BDD-electrolysis) depend on the dosage of SDS. Depollution of the effluents (degradation and mineralization of the organic matter) is related to the reduction in size of micelles formed by SDS and petroleum, and it depends on the treatment used. US and photolysis were inefficient decontamination processes, while BDD-electrolysis favors the complete depletion of micelles. However, the intensification of the efficiency was attained by synergic degradation effects when UV light irradiation and US were coupled with BDD-electrolysis, US/BDD-electrolysis and photo/BDD-electrolysis, respectively. Sulfate (coming from SDS) ions play an important role during the BDD-electrolysis, US/BDD-electrolysis and photo/BDD-electrolysis because persulfate and persulfate radicals are produced (by sulfate activation, applying US or photolysis), improving the efficiency of the processes.

The interaction of ionic heavy metals and carbamoyl benzoic acids was studied approaching zeta potential in aqueous solutions. These carbamoyl acids are innovative chemicals that demonstrate their potential to bind metallic ions as Pb2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+ under specific physicochemical conditions (pH solution and metal-ligand relationship). The amide substituent in each compound induced a specific affinity toward the metallic ions contained in water, and it was studied by measuring zeta potential of an inert surface in contact with the aqueous media. This measurement allowed us to determine the association constants (K-f) with metal ions after defining the stronger interaction between the carbamoyl acids and metallic cations. These results suggest that coagulation-flocculation process could be expected for Pb2+ over all the studied metals (Cu2+, He+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Al3+ and Cd2+). The order of effectiveness of the carbamoyl acids for the separation of Pb2+ is b > c > a according to substituent and the calculated values of If which match the observed behavior.

Further, fabricating multifunctional superhydrophilic coatings using low-cost, nontoxic, environment friendly, and plentiful materials from biological resources is highly desirable. Herein, superhydrophilic coatings with a highly jagged surface morphology were synthesized based on the electrostatic-interaction- or hydrogen-bonding-based LbL assembly of the biotic materials chitosan (CHI) and rice husk ash (RHA) nanosilica, which are abundantly available in nature. The synthesized multilayered (CHI/RHA nanosilica)(n) films were highly transparent and resisted fogging, frosting, and biofouling. Specifically, given the water-absorbing capability of the films, they showed excellent antifogging and antifrosting properties even under aggressive fogging and frosting conditions. Further, the as-prepared superhydrophilic multilayered films, which had a rough surface structure at the micro- and nanoscale, showed potential in reducing the attachment of proteins and various microorganisms, significantly preventing the phenomenon of biofouling in stagnant liquids. Hence, this work provides a new route for assembling superwetting coatings from cost-effective natural materials for use in industrial applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

People with diabetes who also have a condition associated with disability represent one group that is at risk for health disparities. Objective: To examine service utilization among persons with selected disabling conditions and diabetes, compared to those without. Methods: 2007-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Full-Year Consolidated files, medical conditions files, and the 1996-2012 pooled linkage files were merged for this analysis. This analysis focused on five selected conditions that are associated with disability: Visual impairment and blindness, spinal cord injury, intellectual disability, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. Unadjusted and adjusted rates of receipt estimated using various multivariable regression techniques. Results: The proportion with diabetes was higher among those with a selected condition (12.1%) than without (7.1%). Respondents with a selected condition were more likely to have a foot exam; for all other services, the rate of receipt across the two groups was similar. Controlling for other factors, having a selected condition was only a significant factor for foot exams (AOR 1.49, 1.07-2.07). Different factors, but not having a selected condition, were associated with the receipt of each additional service. Conclusions: In general, individuals received the full complement of recommended diabetes management services at a low rate, whether or not they had one of the selected disabling conditions. The comparison results indicated few disparities in diabetes management services among those with selected conditions compared those without these conditions, excepting foot exams, which were more common in the group with a disabling condition.

The aim of this study was to determine individual cytopathologists' rates of indeterminate diagnoses in EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions and their relationship to cytopathologists' experience and volume of pancreatic EUS-FNA examined, as well as the potential impact of departmental consensus review on indeterminate diagnoses. DesignThe diagnostic rates of ATY and SUSP and their underlying risk of malignancy were calculated for six cytopathologists who diagnosed 1,114 of 1,225 EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions from 1/1/2001 to 9/15/2014, and were then compared for the periods before and after the implementation of departmental consensus review during 2009. ResultsThe six cytopathologists diagnosed 10% of cases as indeterminate; 82 (7.4%) as atypical and 29 (2.6%) as suspicious. The individual cytopathologists' indeterminate diagnosis rates varied twofold (6.67-12.80%) and did not correlate with their experience, total or annual volume of EUS-FNAs.

Endotrophin, the C-terminal fragment of the alpha 3 chain of procollagen type VI (also called Pro-C6), is involved in both adipose tissue matrix remodelling and metabolic control. We established a serum assay for endotrophin to assess if this novel adipokine could identify type 2 diabetic patients who respond optimally to PPAR gamma agonists, improving the risk-to-benefit ratio. The BALLET trial (NCT00515632) compared the glucose-lowering effects and safety of the partial PPAR gamma agonist balaglitazone with those of pioglitazone in individuals with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin therapy. The per protocol population (n = 297) was stratified into tertiles based on baseline endotrophin levels. Participants were followed-up after 26 weeks, after which correlational analysis was carried out between endotrophin levels and measures of glucose control. This is a secondary post hoc analysis. Endotrophin was significantly associated with therapeutic response to balaglitazone and pioglitazone. At week 26, only individuals in the upper two tertiles showed significant reductions in HbA(1c) and fasting serum glucose compared with baseline. The OR for a 1% and a 0.5% reduction in HbA(1c) for individuals in the upper two tertiles were 3.83 (95% CI 1.62, 9.04) p < 0.01, and 3.85 (95% CI 1.94, 7.61) p < 0.001, respectively. Endotrophin levels correlated with adipose tissue mass, insulin resistance and fatty liver index. Notably, PPAR gamma-associated adverse effects, such as moderate-to-severe lower extremity oedema, only occurred in the lower tertile.

Using hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a structure-directing agent, the lamellar gamma-AlOOH with porous architectures was successfully prepared via a hydrothermal route. The hierarchical Al2O3 clusters, as the inorganic phase of resin composites, retain the unique structure of lamellar gamma-AlOOH by calcination treatment. In order to enhance the hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of Al2O3 clusters, silane coupling agent (A151) was used to modify the surface of Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation. The surface modified Al2O3 clusters exhibit excellent hydrophobicity, oleophilicity and chemical stability, owing to the tight binding of the hydrophobic functional groups on the inorganic Al2O3 clusters and the inherent stability.of the grafted hydrophobic molecule chains. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites were synthesized by suspension polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) and methacrylic acid butyl ester (MBA) on the surface modified Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation in the presence of coupling agents. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites can effectively separate oils and organic solvents with high oil absorption rate and high oil retention capacity. Moreover, the obtained resin composites have high oil uptake capacities due to the synergy absorption of porous Al2O3 clusters and acrylic resin.

To investigate the effectiveness of immobilizing Cd-bearing residues, two iron oxide precursors, hematite (alpha-Fe3O4) and magnetite (Fe3O4), were reacted with cadmium oxide (CdO) at 600-850 degrees C for 3 h. The XRD results showed that cadmium ferrite spinel (CdFe2O4) was the only Cd-hosting product phase in both systems. Both of the iron oxides were found to be efficient in incorporating Cd into the CdFe2O4 spinel structure, but Fe3O4 was more reactive in the Cd incorporated at low temperatures. The weight factions of the crystalline phases in the sintered products were quantified by the Rietveld refinement method, and the transformation ratio (TR) index was used to reveal the Cd incorporation efficiencies of the iron oxides. A TR of 100% was achieved at 850 degrees C, indicating the potential for efficient stabilization of Cd through thermal reactions with iron oxide precursors. The Cd stabilization effects were further assessed by leaching CdFe2O4 and CdO in constant pH (2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) leaching tests. The results revealed the incongruent dissolution of CdFe2O4. The amount of Cd leached from the CdFe2O4 was more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that from the CdO, signifying a highly promising and reliable strategy for Cd stabilization. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to systematically report the roles of different Fe-rich precursors in Cd stabilization mechanism, and indicates the significant reduction of Cd leachability via CdFe2O4 formation.

At sufficiently high sulphide flux, microgalvanic corrosion can be supported between areas of the surface covered by compact sulphide deposits and other areas covered only by a porous deposit. This leads to excessive crystal growth at the cathodes (compact film) and localized corrosion damage at the anodes (porous film). The transport of Cu(I) between the two areas, required to sustain this process, appears to occur predominantly by the solution transport of Cu-sulphide complex or clusters.

Liquid and gas phase Reynolds numbers (N-Re,N- (L) and N-Re,N- G) were varied in the ranges from 1061 to 23,150 and 130 to 100,000 respectively. As part of this work, we tracked the entry and exit of the tracer particle in the coiled flow structure using an array of strategically placed scintillation detectors. From these experiments, it became possible to extract the residence time distribution (RTD) by enumeration of the trajectories of the tracer particle through the flow system.

However, biochar is less effective than activated carbon in immobilising contaminants. To increase the efficiency of contaminant binding by biochar, an alternative method of biochar activation that leads to an increase in surface area is proposed. Herein, we improve the biochar by subjection to a range of activation techniques using microwaves, carbon dioxide or superheated steam. To test their effectiveness, the untreated and activated biochars were added at 5% w/w into three different industrially contaminated soils sampled from areas around a coal plant (KOK and KB) and a bitumen processing plant (POPI). The surface area (SSA) of biochar subjected to the activation techniques increased significantly. The SSA of the original biochar was 11 m(2)/g, while those of the activated biochars was 443 m(2)/g (microwave), 512 m(2)/g (CO2) and 841 m(2)/g (superheated steam). The addition of activated biochar reduced the freely dissolved PAHs (C-free in the KOK and POPI soils by up to 86% (from 153 to 22 ng/L and from 172 to 24 ng/L, respectively) and in the KB soil by up to 70% (from 52 to 16 ng/L) compared to the untreated soils. Even more pronounced reductions were observed in the concentration of bioaccessible PAHs (C-bioacc). The activated biochars reduced C-bioacc in all soils by almost 100% (from 1.39 to 0.03 for KOK, from 1.92 to 0.01 for POPI and from 1.16 to 0.04 mg/kg for KB) compared with the untreated soil. This research shows that biochar activation by different methods leads to significant enhancements in contaminant binding and thus is a promising method for increasing the potential use of biochar in soil remediation.

This model based design strategy and an extensive parametric analysis enables gaining an understanding of how individual steps within TSA cycles affect the achievable purity and recovery of the CO2 product. This insight is used to evaluate three novel TSA cycle configurations by assessing them based on their productivity and energy consumption. The influence of heat integration, cycle scheduling and an external drying step on the performance of the cycles is systematically evaluated. This detailed analysis reveals the importance of the cycle configuration and provides a basis to rationally design TSA cycles for post-combustion CO2 capture. Using a commercial zeolite 13X adsorbent our novel TSA cycle design achieves for the first time CO2 capture and storage specifications (96% CO2 purity and 90% recovery) with moderate heating temperatures of up to 420 K while avoiding the use of compression or vacuum. The specific energy consumption and productivity of this cycle are similar to amine-based absorption processes.

Recent experiments showed that sulfidation of nanoscopic zinc oxide particles leads to an outward growth and the formation of voids inside the particles. In this work, we derive a micro-scale model to describe this phenomenon. The model accounts for nucleation and growth of voids inside the particles, diffusion of Zn and O through the product layer, and deposition of the solid product at the particle surface as a result of the reaction between ZnO and H2S. The model is thus opposite to the well known shrinking core model where an inward growth of the product layer is assumed. To explore the effect of the outward growth on the dynamics of a packed bed adsorber the micro-scale model is combined with a macro-scale model that accounts for intra-pellet diffusion and convection along the packed bed. In the limit of fast nucleation and growth of voids inside the zinc oxide particles, the micro-scale model shows a qualitatively similar conversion profile to the shrinking core model, while when nucleation controls an inflection point in conversion profile is found. On the macro-scale, the outward growth can cause the clogging of pores inside the pellets which prevents the pellets from reaching full conversion. This leads to shorter breakthrough times of the packed bed due to the sealing of unreacted zinc oxide. Our results thus provide a possible explanation of the incomplete conversion of zinc oxide in packed beds.",2019,69,12,EC2HA,2020/01/05

The target species including N-heterocyclic pollutants (pyrrole, pyrimidine and pyridine), Humic Substances and salt of sodium sulfate were removed from the simulated wastewater by this process. Within electrocatalysis, pyrrole and pyrimidine were degraded prior to pyridine due to their lower Gibbs energy barriers as 6.79 kcal and 16.89 kcal, respectively, and thus were easier attacked by hydroxyl radical generated on the electrode surface. Then the pyridine together with the salt was removed efficiently during electrodialysis.

The northern Australian tropical region is a particularly challenging environment for human physical activity and regional development projects. Increases in temperature and rainfall will exacerbate these challenges. Knowledge of past climatic trends and their impacts provides important information for prudent development planning. This paper quantifies the observed changes in temperature and rainfall across northern Australia for the period 1911-2013, based on Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) temperature and rainfall data for 4 coastal and 3 inland locations across the region. We compared two 30 yr periods, 1911-1940 and 1984-2013, to the baseline period 1961-1990 averages and SD values. Trends were identified in decadal monthly temperatures, maximum temperatures > 30 degrees C and minimum temperatures > 21 degrees C, shifts in the daily maximum and minimum temperature frequency distribution curves and changes in seasonal rainfall above and below the +/- 1 SD values. The results indicate this tropical region is now warmer and wetter compared to the 1911-1940 period with an increase in the number of days > 30 and > 33 degrees C. Coastal warming was more pronounced than at inland locations and shows seasonal variations; whilst western and central inland areas have become wetter, little trend change was apparent in the eastern rainfall. With projections of further warming, development plans for the region need to incorporate the associated deleterious impacts on human activity.

Areas covered: This article will examine the evidence for the use of NSAIDs in AD by discussing the proposed mechanism of action, results from epidemiologic studies, and data from randomized controlled trials. In addition, a survey of several novel approaches to targeting inflammatory pathways currently in pre-clinical and clinical phases of development is presented. These agents primarily act to modulate microglial functioning, enhance amyloid-beta phagocytosis, suppress potentially harmful proinflammatory responses, or enhance systemic immunity. Expert commentary: While long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced incidence of AD in epidemiologic studies, randomized controlled trials have not replicated these findings. Thus, NSAID use cannot currently be recommended either for primary prevention or treatment of AD.

MethodsA 10-year retrospective search for patients with biopsy-proven NUM to the urothelial tract yielded 25 urine samples from 14 patients. Two cytopathologists blinded to the original cytology diagnosis reviewed the cytology and histology slides. The incidence, cytomorphologic features, diagnostic accuracy, factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy, and clinical impact of the cytology result were studied. ResultsThe incidence of NUM was <1%. The male:female ratio was 1.3. An abnormality was detected in 60% of the cases; however, in only 4% of the cases, a primary site was identified accurately. Of the false negatives, 96% was deemed as sampling errors and 4% was interpretational. Patient management was not impacted in any of the false-negative cases due to concurrent or past tissue diagnosis. ConclusionColon cancer was the most frequent secondary tumor. Sampling error attributed to the false-negative results. Necrosis and dirty background was often associated with metastatic lesions from colon.

Metaldehyde, used as the challenge molecule in this study, is a common molluscicide that (like many highly soluble contaminants) has frequently breached European regulatory limits in surface waters. The new method involves graphene with higher hydrophilic characteristics (single-layer graphene oxide, SLGO) as a system that participates in a redox reaction with hydrogen peroxide and which can potentially stabilize the OH generated, which subsequently breaks down organic contaminants. The modified Fenton's reaction has shown to be effective in degrading metaldehyde in natural waters (>92% removal), even at high contaminant concentrations (50 mg metaldehyde/L) and in the presence of high background organic matter and dissolved salts. The reaction is relatively pH insensitive. SLGO maintained its catalytic performance over 3 treatment cycles when immobilized. Its performance gradually decreased over time, reaching around 50% of starting performance on the 10th treatment cycle.

The code running on the GPU is generated with the help of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The first and second spatial derivatives of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized by the sixth-order central compact finite-difference schemes. Two flow fields are simulated. The first test case is the simulated flow around a square cylinder, with the results providing good estimations of the wake region mechanics and vortex shedding. The second test case is the simulated flow around a circular cylinder. This case was selected to better understand the effects of sharp corners on the force coefficients. It was observed that the estimation of the force coefficients did not result in any troubles in the case of a circular cylinder. Additionally, the performance values obtained for the calculation time for the solution of the Poisson equation are compared with the values for other CPUs and GPUs from the literature. Consequently, approximately 3x and 20x speedups are achieved in comparison with GPU (using CUSP library) and CPU, respectively.

In this work, porous carbon beads (PCBs) of around 1.5 mm were synthesized via phase inversion route followed by carbonization. Specially, porous polymeric beads (PPBs) were obtained by injecting of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer solution containing phenolic resins into coagulation bath. The porous structure of PPBs can be adjusted by simply altering the composition of coagulation bath, which further determined the final microstructure of PCBs. Mercury porosimeter, SEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization revealed that the resultant PCBs possess uniform spherical shape, abundant macrospore and high mesoporosity. The sample obtained under the moderate phase inversion condition, i.e. PCBs-2, possesses highest BET surface area (1166 m(2)/g), mesoporous pore volume (0.249 cm(3)/g) and pore size (2.87 nm). To present the removal performance of PCBs for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the adsorption behaviors under static and dynamic conditions were investigated. The static adsorption result indicated that PCBs-2 exhibits the largest adsorption capacities for benzene (1.467 g/g), toluene (1.229 g/g), n-hexane (0.600 g/g) and acetone (0.770 g/g).

As widely accepted, the alterations of mitochondrial function are actively engaged in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. With growing interest in the mitochondria as a potential target for understanding AD, it has even been hypothesized that deficits in these organelles may be at the heart of the progression of AD itself. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies that suggest a role for mitochondrial (dys)function in AD and to provide a survey on latest developments regarding AD-related mitochondrial therapeutics. Expert commentary: As outlined in a plethora of studies, there is no doubt that mitochondria play a major role in several stages of AD progression.

Studying on electrocatalytic activity revealed that the presence of CoS2 nanoparticles along with MWCNTs and Pt nanoparticles played a prominent role in enhancement of proton reduction to hydrogen gas. The possible mechanism of electrocatalytic activity by nanocomposite films is also discussed. The PPy(CoS2)MWCNTsPt nanocomposite film exhibits extremely low overpotential (0.03 V vs. RHE), and high current density for HER in acidic solution. The activity enhancement can be attributed to the large active electrochemical surface area of MWCNTs and also porous structure of PPy provides excellent attachment of CoS2 and Pt nanostructures to the matrix.

It comprises cytokine-producing lymphoid cells from the immune system and endocrine cells secreting cortisol, catecholamines, and thyroid hormones. The intimate organization of the immune system and endocrine system in one single organ makes bidirectional signalling between these possible. In this review we explore putative interactions between the thyroid and immune system in the head kidney. We give a short overview of the thyroid system, and consider the evidence for the presence of thyroid follicles in the head lcidney as a normal, healthy trait in fishes. From mammalian studies we gather data on the effects of three important pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6) on the thyroid system. A general picture that emerges is that pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit the activity of the thyroid system at different targets. Extrapolating from these studies, we suggest that the interaction of the thyroid system by paracrine actions of cytokines in the head kidney is involved in fine-tuning the availability and redistribution of energy substrates during acclimation processes such as an immune response or stress response.

The effect of the textural, morphological and structural properties of plate shaped composites calcined at different temperatures on the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of formaldehyde in gas phase is analyzed. Silicates allows TiO2 extrusion into flat plates with a content of 50 wt% of titania. All shaped materials present adequate mechanical resistance to be scaled-up for use in continuous-flow gas-phase catalytic reactors. Thermal treatment at 500 degrees C ensures an optimum combination of mechanical, textural and HCHO adsorption properties. The silicates cover part of the TiO2 particles thus reducing the fraction of TiO2 actually exposed on the surface of the composites, essential to carried out the photocatalytic process, but they also allow controlling TiO2 dispersion and the amount of HCHO adsorbed. The HCHO degradation rate is enhanced with all the silicate-TiO2 composites with respect to that of the benchmark TiO2. The incorporation of titania into the silicate matrix favors the gas phase removal of HCHO in the following sequence: MTi > KTi > STi > BTi > TiO2. The exposed fraction of titania particles and the size of the TiO2 anatase crystalline domains determine the efficiency of the hybrid material, which is optimized in high-aluminum kaolinite and mordenite based hybrids.

Studies have demonstrated the utility of the measurement of potassium (K) from DBS punches to estimate HCT. Because there is significant accrual of RBCs at the DBS perimeter, we investigated whether K measurement from ring-shaped specimens inclusive of the perimeter might provide an advantage over conventional interior circular sub-punch samples to estimate HCT. Methods: Primary samples were Li-heparin whole blood, with HCT as measured on concurrently-drawn K-EDTA specimens. DBS were formed by bolus addition of 40 mu L whole blood to filter paper cards. Total bloodspot area was determined by image analysis. Removal of center sub-punch (P) samples of fixed area produced remainder ring (R) samples inclusive of the perimeter. Samples were extracted in K-EDTA (2.5 mmol/L) and measured for diluent-corrected K per area (alpha, mu mol K/cm(2)). Results: Forty-three patient samples were utilized. a was normally distributed: alpha(P) = 1.23 +/- 0.26 mu mol K/cm(2); alpha(R) = 1.86 +/- 0.41 mu mol K/cm(2); alpha(R)/alpha(P) = 1.51 +/- 0.15. alpha was correlated with HCT: alpha(P) = 0.030 HCT(%)+0.015 mu mol K/cm(2) (r(2) = 0.795); alpha(R) = 0.052 HCT(%)+0.010 mu mol K/cm(2) (r(2) = 0.912), but with higher resolution and lesser error for a(R). Conclusions: K per area (alpha) was significantly higher in R samples vs. P samples, with higher resolution for alpha(R) vs. HCT.

Characterization of the LIS/PAN NF confirmed its favorable structural and surface properties for effective Li+ adsorption. The LIS/PAN NF was mechanically suitable as a microfiltration membrane with high water flux and low pressure requirement. Breakthrough experiments at varied feed concentrations (C-f), seawater fiowrates (F), and NF thicknesses (Z) revealed the dynamic adsorption behavior of the filter. The seawater residence time was most critical and must be kept >= 0.12 min at any given C-f and Z to maximize the Li+ capacity of the filter. This can be conveniently achieved by adjusting the F of the process. Analogous to a packed bed system, the predictive power of nine breakthrough models were determined through non-linear regression analyses. Results reveal that bed-depth-space-time, Bohart-Adams (BA) and Thomas models adequately predicted the performance of the filter albeit BA exhibited the best agreement.

Endotrophin seems to be one of the key players of collagen VI-mediated signalling effects, including its pro-fibrotic nature and chemoattractant properties for macrophages, while also playing an important role in cancer progression and the chemoresistance of tumour cells. The glucose-lowering class of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) that mediate their action through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma also exerts important effects on endotrophin by reducing the transcription of parental collagen VI molecules.

The discrete bubble model is combined with the volume of fluid approach to account for a proper free surface boundary condition at the liquid-gas interface.

The numerical simulation is conducted by means of the open source computational fluid dynamics library OpenFOAM (R). In order to validate the numerical model, experimental results of a bubble column are used. The numerical prediction shows an overall good agreement compared to the experimental data. The effect of injection conditions and the influence of the drag closures on bubble dynamics are investigated in the current paper.

However, the same cluster diameter correlation based on energy dissipation was used in all cases, which may give a smaller cluster diameter than single particle diameter at low solids fluxes. In this paper, a description of the solids mass transfer between the dilute and dense phases in heterogeneous gas-solid flow is proposed to replace the correlation of cluster diameter to avoid some problems associated with the empirical calculation of the cluster diameter. This cluster description can facilitate the prediction of the drag coefficient at the scale of numerical cells in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at extremely low solids fluxes and the radial heterogeneity in large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with downward particle velocities near the wall.

The IO@CaCO3 adsorbent removed both anionic (As(V) and Cr(VI)) and cationic (Pb(II)) heavy metal ions at a rate orders of magnitude faster than any conventional adsorbents reported to date; due to synergistic effect of needle-like IO and CaCO3, it completely removed (99.99%) the toxic heavy metal ions from wastewater in only 9 min. In addition, it exhibited excellent As(V), Cr(VI), and Pb(II) removal capacities of 184.1, 251.6, and 1041.9 mg g(-1), respectively, over a wide pH range. The heavy metal ion adsorption mechanism involves ion-exchange reactions between the cationic/anionic heavy metal ions and the positively/negatively charged groups on the adsorbent. Along with the batch adsorption tests, heavy metal ion removal by IO@CaCO3 was also performed by column filtration, demonstrating the potential of IO@CaCO3 for use in practical applications.

The tripartite model of racism includes personally mediated racism, institutionalized racism, and the less-oft studied internalized racism. Internalized racism - or negative beliefs about one's racial group - results from cultural racism that is endemic in American society. In this project, we studied whether these negative stereotypes are associated with mental health among African-Americans and Caribbean Blacks.Design. Using secondary data from the National Survey of American Life, we investigated the association between internalized racism and mental health (measured by depressive symptoms and serious psychological distress (SPD)) among these two groups. We also explored whether ethnicity/nativity and mastery moderate the association between internalized racism and mental health among African-Americans and Caribbean Blacks.Results. Internalized racism was positively associated with depressive symptoms and SPD among all Black subgroups. However, internalized racism was a weaker predictor of SPD among foreign-born Caribbean Blacks than US-born Caribbean Blacks and US-born African-Americans. Additionally, higher mastery was protective against distress associated with internalized racism.Conclusion. Internalized racism is an important yet understudied determinant of mental health among Blacks.

However, the cost of carbon capture has to be reduced to manageable levels before it can be deployed at an industrial scale. Potassium carbonate solutions (K2CO3) are good solvents for CO2 capture because they have low regeneration energy, low degradation rates and low corrosivity. However, one shortcoming of K2CO3 is that it has slow reaction kinetics with CO2. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of promoters to K2CO3 solutions. In this study, the catalysis kinetics of a carbonic anhydrase (NZCA) promoter was tested via the stopped flow technique and a wetted wall column (WWC). The Michaelis-Menten catalysis parameter (k(cat)/K-m) was determined to be 2.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) at 298 K, allowing the catalysis reaction activation energy of 51 +/- 1 kJ/mol to be obtained at 298-328 K. The catalysis coefficient of the NZCA was determined to be 5.3 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) using a WWC in 30 wt% potassium carbonate solutions (pH similar to 11-12) at 323 K.

In this paper, a description of the solids mass transfer between the dilute and dense phases in heterogeneous gas-solid flow is proposed to replace the correlation of cluster diameter to avoid some problems associated with the empirical calculation of the cluster diameter. This cluster description can facilitate the prediction of the drag coefficient at the scale of numerical cells in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at extremely low solids fluxes and the radial heterogeneity in large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with downward particle velocities near the wall. It is integrated with two-fluid model (TFM) to simulate the fluid dynamics in an industrial-scale CFB riser accurately, which is also accelerated significantly by using the predicted radial voidage distribution as the initial condition of CFD.

A common therapy for ARDS patients is mechanical ventilation (MV). However, poorly applied MV can be potentially fatal and optimal MV settings are patient specific. Thus, choosing a good positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)-level compromise is a clinical challenge. Physiological modeling of the lung is one way to support the selection of the optimal settings for mechanical ventilation. This research makes the reasonably well-supported assumption that optimal PEEP is in the region of minimal elastance of the lung-tissue. The first order model of pulmonary mechanics (FOM) was modified in two differing ways in order to determine the patient-specific pressure range that coincides with minimal elastance. The extensions to the FOM (multiplicative elastance correction and additive volume correction parameters) are compared and evaluated. The addition of the correction parameters ultimately improved the consistency of the modeled elastance across PEEP levels for most patients tested. The results for minimal elastance were in very similar ranges for both approaches. Although this consistency offers a partial validation of the robustness of the approaches, discernment of the optimal approach cannot be determined. Further validation across differing patient states and experimental inputs must be undertaken to determine which method is more representative of true patient physiology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The degradation kinetics, the time necessary to remove 90% of the contaminant and the optimal reactants concentration were proposed. The treatment in pure water, (synthetic) wastewater and urine was assessed, in an effort to identify the opportunities and pitfalls the application of process would encounter in a field application.

Repair of such pavements relies mainly on overlaying with additional SCC or asphalt concrete layers without accounting for possible strength and durability recovery by the mechanism known by self-healing. Would the latter be considered in repair plans, the problems associated with rigid pavements deterioration can be solved with the lowest possible cost. The present study aims at investigating the potential of self-healing and possible recovery of mechanical properties and durability of SCC considering key parameters, stress level at loading, loading age, and curing regime (water, air) and time period. For that, standard SCC cylinders (150x300mm) were cast from one SCC mixture, prepared at a w/c ratio of .45, cured for different periods in water, then subjected to varying compressive stress levels ranging from 80 to 100% of their ultimate load capacity, before re-cured in water or air for additional time periods, and finally tested for ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and compressive mechanical response. The damage index for SCC, in terms of UPV, showed slight increases for stress level of up to 95%, before sharply increased when SCC was fully damaged. SCC cured for higher time periods, prior to loading to stresses of up to 95%, received more internal damage, yet the impact of loading age on internal damage became minimal for fully crushed SCC specimens. Re-curing in water contributed more than in air to cracks' filling and mechanical behaviour recovery. SCC specimens stressed to levels of 90% or less then re-cured were able to regain their original mechanical characteristics, whereas those loaded to stress levels of 95% then re-cured lost tangible portions of their mechanical properties. As may be expected, fully damaged then re-cured SCC lost major portions of their mechanical properties; reaching as high 85%. Empirical models, developed in this work, showed that there exists a very good correlation between residual mechanical properties and a certain recovery index, defined in terms of damage indexes at loading and after re-curing.",2019,307,14,ED2QD,2018/11/16

We incubated a 25-mm strip of excised osteoarthritic human tibial plateau in 50 % ionic iodine contrast and imaged it using a small-animal spectral scanner with a cadmium telluride photon-processing detector to quantify the iodine through the thickness of the articular cartilage. We imaged both spectroscopic phantoms and osteoarthritic tibial plateau samples. The iodine distribution as an inverse marker of GAG content was presented in the form of 2D and 3D images after applying a basis material decomposition technique to separate iodine in cartilage from bone. We compared this result with a histological section stained for GAG. The iodine in cartilage could be distinguished from subchondral bone and quantified using multi-energy CT. The articular cartilage showed variation in iodine concentration throughout its thickness which appeared to be inversely related to GAG distribution observed in histological sections.

The influence of ammonia and hydrogen pressures was investigated. It was found that ammonia pressure did not influence the reaction, while extra hydrogen in the reaction mixture was beneficial for dodecanol conversion and dodecylamine selectivity. A dodecylamine yield of 83.8% was achieved with RuiC catalyst at 150 degrees C, 4 bar ammonia and 2 bar hydrogen after 24 h reaction. Zero reaction order in ammonia typically implies that the rate limiting step is not related to amination, but rather to a preceding dehydrogenation step. Experimentally observed unusual positive order in hydrogen in dehydrogenation was related to deactivation by surface coking. Partial surface regeneration requires presence of hydrogen, thus explaining a positive reaction order towards this reactant. A detailed analysis of kinetic regularities, which due to specificity of the reaction mechanism could be done separately for activity and selectivity, allowed advancing a mathematical model adequately describing experimental observations.

In all cases, conditions as mild as 90 degrees C and 90 min were enough to completely remove all CO2 adsorbed. After that, a number of adsorption-desorption cycles at 110 degrees C for DT (60 min) and PEI (75 min) samples were carried out in order to study their cyclability. The recycling of CO2 adsorbents after their lifespan was studied by analysing the physicochemical properties and CO2 uptake of recycled samples obtained by calcination and subsequent refunctionalization with DT or PEI. Materials obtained after grafting the calcined samples exhibited progressively thicker silica walls and lower silanol surface concentration, yielding a smaller amine efficiency during CO2 capture.

The galvanic corrosion of a high voltage conductor assembly consisting of a cylindrical CFRP rod surrounded by tightly wound aluminum wires has been investigated through experimental work and modeling. The main corrosion product is Al(OH)(3), which presents as a gelatinous substance in the crevices between the Al wires. The formation of Al(OH)(3) was observed to coincide with the decay in the galvanic corrosion current. A new analytical model was developed to investigate if the decay could be caused by corrosion products restricting the transport of oxygen to the cathode. Modeling of the oxygen diffusion through the deposited corrosion products generated galvanic corrosion rates that agreed well with the experimental measurements after an early exponential decay period. The findings suggest that the corrosion product deposition may be the most important galvanic corrosion rate controlling mechanism in this geometry and similar geometries.

Pyrolysis was conducted at 530 degrees C in a fluidized bed reactor. The catalytic post-treatment of the hot pyrolysis vapors was carried out in a fixed bed reactor using gamma-alumina (gamma-Al2O3) as a catalyst.

K, f, and D* showed increased CV (> 30 %) over the histogram. ADC, D, DDC alpha, and DDCK were strongly correlated (rho > 0.9), DDC alpha and alpha were not correlated (rho = 0.083). Perfusion- and kurtosis-related parameters displayed larger, more variable CV across the histogram, indicating observed clinical changes outside of D/DDC in these models should be interpreted with caution. Centiles below 5th for all parameters show high CV and are unreliable as diffusion metrics. The stretched exponential model behaved well for both DDC alpha and alpha, making it a strong candidate for modelling multiple-b-value diffusion imaging data. aEuro cent ADC has good repeatability as low 5th centile of the histogram distribution. aEuro cent High CV was observed for all parameters at extremes of histogram. aEuro cent Parameters from the stretched exponential model showed low coefficients of variation. aEuro cent The median ADC, D, DDC (alpha) , and DDC (K) are highly correlated and repeatable. aEuro cent Perfusion/kurtosis parameters showed high CV variations across their histogram distributions.",2021,17,1,EF1GS,2019/11/14

A green hybrothermal method was used to functionalize CFF with coral-like MnO2 nanostructures to improve the pseudocapacitance properties of the hybrid composites. These CFF/MnO2 composites are used as excellent flexible electrodes for high-performance electrochemical super capacitors applications. The morphological, structural and crystalline properties of composites were analysed by using various techniques such as FE-SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical performance was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In a three-electrode system, the CV tests reveal the superior specific capacitance of 467 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with capacitance retention of 99.7% and the columbic efficiency remains as high as 993% after 5000 cycles, demonstrating an outstanding electrochemical cyclic stability. In addition, high-performance device fabricated with CFF/MnO2 demonstrated excellent energy density of 20 W h/kg at a power density of 0.175 kW h/kg. These novel electrode materials could be potential candidate for applications in practical and large-scale energy storage systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the mixed graphene dioxide (GO) was reduced during PAHD coating of TiO2-GO nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed TiO2 presented as a mixture phase of anatase, rutile and brookite in the TiO2-rGO nanocomposites. UV- vis absorption spectra of TiO2-rGO nanocomposites indicated that mixing rGO into TiO2 particles could reduce band gap energy, thereby enhancing utilization efficiency of visible light. Photocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposites was measured by the degradation of three pharmaceuticals under UV and visible light irradiation, including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole. TiO2-rGO nanocomposites exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activities as compared to pure TiO2, and were strongly affected by the amount of rGO in the catalysts. While photocatalysis with 2.7% rGO achieved 54% degradation of carbamazepine, 81% of ibuprofen, and 92% of sulfamethoxazole after 180 min UV irradiation, the mineralization rates of the pharmaceuticals were similar between 52% and 59%. The photocatalytic oxidation of pharmaceuticals by the prepared nanocomposites followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. There was an obvious positive correlation between degradation rate constant and quantum flux for both UV and visible light, with correlation coefficient of 0.991. In addition, long-term photoactivity testing of TiO2-rGO coated SOFs demonstrated the durability of the immobilized TiO2-rGO nanocomposites on optical fibers for water treatment.

Study design: This prospective study of feasibility and patient acceptability recruited women interested in a postpartum LNG IUS and placed the LNG IUS under ultrasound guidance on days 14-20 postpartum. We determined feasibility by our ability to recruit and insert the LNG IUS in our predetermined sample size of 50 women. We measured our primary acceptability outcome at 6 months postpartum with the question: ""Would you recommend Mirena placement at 2 weeks postpartum to a friend?"" Other outcomes included expulsion and pain. The three study visits consisted of (1) insertion visit (14-20 days postpartum), (2) standard postpartum visit with a string check (6 weeks postpartum) and (3) research visit with sonography and assessment of the primary outcome (6 months postpartum). Results: We enrolled 50 women over 8 months, all of whom received LNG IUS. Forty-three of the 50 (86%) provided follow-up data for the primary outcome. Of those, 93% (40/43) would recommend 2-week LNG IUS insertion to a friend, and 86% (37/43) continued using their LNG IUS at the conclusion of the 6-month visit. There were two partial expulsions; one was symptomatic. There were no uterine perforations. Conclusions: LNG IUS inserted at 2 weeks postpartum is feasible and acceptable to patients. These results offer evidence to support intrauterine contraception insertion prior to the onset of ovulation and at a potentially more convenient time point in the postpartum period.

Because of environmental considerations, the use of organic solvents is limited for this process. Ionic liquids have unique properties, which broaden the applications of these types of solvents for EDS. In continuation of our previous work on the application of task-specific and acidic phosphonium ionic liquids (PIL) for EDS, tri-n-butyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)phosphonium bromide (ITBHEN[Br]) was synthesized, then, the EDS performance of it, as a neutral PIL with alcoholic moiety, was studied in details. At first, the effect of various parameters, such as: the reaction time, temperature, the volume ratio of [TBHEP][Br]ifuel, the initial concentration of sulfur in the liquid fuel and the types of the sulfur compounds on the extraction efficiency were investigated. The obtained results of experimental investigations show that [TBHEP][Br] (with the values of the extraction efficiency about 56, 70 and 41% for benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and dimethyldibenzothiophene (DMDBT), respectively) acts as a suitable extractant for removal of the sulfur compounds from liquid fuel. Also, the theoretical calculations demonstrate that hydrogen of alcohol, as well as alpha-hydrogens of the methylene groups, connecting to phosphonium, can provide interaction between dibenzothiophene and PIL in the extraction process. However, it is concluded that [TBHEP][Br] is more suitable extractant than our previous report, PIL with acetic acid tag for EDS of the liquid fuel, because of low corrosivity and price. So, the results of this work support the idea of rational design, synthesis and application of task-specific ionic liquids for the green EDS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of THMs and HANs from free and combined histidine and glycine during chlorination was firstly examined and compared in this study with an emphasis on their differences. The impacts of chlorine dose, pH, ammonia nitrogen and bromide were evaluated and mechanistic formation pathways were proposed.

These compounds are typically synthesized under hydro (solvo)thermal conditions at relatively low temperature using various organic amines. Comprehensive reviews have summarized the preparation and structures of these main group metal chalcogenidometalates. A particular research challenge in this field is using the chelating imines, such as 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), in the synthesis of inorganic-organic hybrid main group metal chalcogenidometalates because their transition metal complexes can add new optical or electronic properties to the host chalcogenide compounds. Thus, a series of unique chalcogenidometalates with M-hen and M-bpy complexes (M = metal ions) have been isolated recently. These compounds have unusual optical and photoelectronic properties compared with those of the amine series. The present review focuses on recent developments in the synthesis, structures, and properties of these chalcogenidometalates. A comprehensive outline is provided of the chalcogenidometalate compounds with discrete M-phen/bpy complex cations or covalently bonded M-phen/bpy moieties.

(1) In many cases, the ac breakdown voltages of these solidified alcohol aqueous solutions were higher than that of ice. Average breakdown voltage of ethylene glycol shows the highest value among the tested solutions. It is 1.8 times higher than average value of ice.

BEA type zeolites, with high content of Lewis and Bronsted sites, promoted the catalytic D4 ring-opening leading on the formation of smaller alpha-omega-silanediols, which are narrower molecules able to diffuse into the channel system. Wet oxidation processes were used for the regeneration of a spent BEA zeolite, including ozonation and Fenton-like treatment. Both treatments were optimized to recover almost completely the D4 uptake of the iron-exchanged Fe-BEA in the first use. Thus, its feasibility to be reused was evaluated in successive adsorption/oxidation cycles, recovering up to 80% in at least three subsequent steps. However, in further cycles the accumulation of D4 and/or by-products led to a successive decline in the catalytic activity of the zeolites, hampering not only the capacity to transform D4 into lineal silanediols, thus reducing the adsorption capacity, but also the catalytic activity towards promoting Fenton-like reactions during regeneration.

However, the difficulties in separation and recycle of CDs arising from its high water solubility and low molecular weight limit its application in this area. Herein, we demonstrate a one-pot solvothermal method for fabricating NiFe2O4-carbon dot (NiFeC) nanocomposites, which solve its limitations and mitigate the usual fabrication drawbacks by self-assembly such as relatively weak interaction, time-consuming and lack of recycling potential. Series characterizations confirmed the successful fabrication of NiFeC nanocomposites with great uniformity in morphology and exhibited excellent dispersibility in water. The adsorption behavior of the as-prepared nanocomposites was systematically studied using kinetic and equilibrium experiments. Owing to abundant hydroxy and carboxyl groups introduced from CDs, NiFeC nanocomposites offered significantly enhanced tetracycline (TC) removal ability with the maximum adsorption capacity of 591.72 mg g(-1), as well as the excellent regenerability. Moreover, XPS and FT-IR analysis revealed the adsorption mechanism was attributed to surface complexation, cation exchange and electrostatic interaction between TC and the NiFeC. With the higher adsorption capacity and simpler synthesis method than traditional adsorbents, NiFeC nanocomposites have promising potential for the removal of TC from wastewater.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of two dRVVT reagents, with special attention to the influence of anticoagulant therapy. Methods: STA (R)-Staclot (R) dRVV Screen/Confirm (Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and dRVT-LS/dRVTL-LR (Haematex, Hornsby, Australia) were evaluated on 443 patient samples [358 consecutive patients with LAC request including six antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients, 18 non-consecutively selected APS patients and 37 vitamin K antagonists (VKA)-treated and 30 direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)-treated non-APS patients].

Characterization of the LIS/PAN NF confirmed its favorable structural and surface properties for effective Li+ adsorption. The LIS/PAN NF was mechanically suitable as a microfiltration membrane with high water flux and low pressure requirement. Breakthrough experiments at varied feed concentrations (C-f), seawater fiowrates (F), and NF thicknesses (Z) revealed the dynamic adsorption behavior of the filter. The seawater residence time was most critical and must be kept >= 0.12 min at any given C-f and Z to maximize the Li+ capacity of the filter. This can be conveniently achieved by adjusting the F of the process. Analogous to a packed bed system, the predictive power of nine breakthrough models were determined through non-linear regression analyses.

The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of T-leaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict T-leaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20-35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. T-leaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that T-leaf is best explained by air temperature (T-air) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in T-leaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteoro logical data are available.

To develop a competitive and commercially viable technology, better mercury capture and regeneration performances of regenerable sorbents are required. For this purpose, non-thermal plasma was used to treat the magnetic sorbents FeMnOx synthesized by co-precipitation. The mercury adsorption tests showed that the treated sorbents with non-thermal plasma had higher mercury removal efficiency than raw sorbents, and longer treatment time resulted in higher efficiency. The main reason was that the content of the high valence manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were greatly increased by non thermal plasma treatment, and this played a significant role in the mercury removal process. Further analysis showed that the lattice oxygen coming from the stepwise reduction of manganese oxide (MnO2 -> Mn2O3 -> MnO) served as an oxidant in the reaction with Hg degrees. The NO, SO2 and H2O inhibited the mercury adsorption while O-2 and HCl promoted mercury removal. High valence of manganese oxides and lattice oxygen were consumed during mercury adsorption, while non-thermal plasma treatment could replenish it and increase mercury removal regeneration performance better than without non thermal plasma treatment. In summary, the combination of magnetic separation, thermal regeneration and plasma treatment makes FeMnOx an excellent recyclable sorbent for mercury emission control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, based on the optimization in terms of the thermal conductivity, compressive and residual strengths, it is recommended to incorporate high volume POFA and addition of polymer fibres exceeding 0.3 vol.% fraction for non-structural application in building materials.

The objective of this work was to rigorously determine a kinetic model in order to understand the behavior of the reactor in real indoor air conditions and to relate the kinetic parameters to physical and chemical mechanisms. Three main parameters were studied: initial toluene concentration, light irradiance and air stream velocity. The experimental results were used to calculate the single-pass removal efficiency for different operating conditions and to establish a relationship between the single-pass removal efficiency, light irradiance and air stream velocity. This relationship was integrated into an overall reaction rate law based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The kinetic model obtained was then validated for various experimental conditions.

Quaternized C. obtusifolia seed gum (seed gum-CHPTAC) was obtained through seed gum etherification with N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC). The influence of cationic monomer concentration, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were studied for the synthesis based on total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals from the POME.

Commercialization of this process depends on the development of suitable membrane modules. The earlier studies were performed on flat sheet membranes. Hollow fiber modules seem to be the most suitable module for this process on account of high packing density for handling the large amount gasoline-stream in the refineries. In this study, a mathematical model is derived for determining the performance of axial flow type hollow fiber module. The experiment could not be performed on hollow fiber module due to unavailability of commercial modules. However, tubular modules are commercially available. Tubular and hollow fiber modules have similar geometry, and their mathematical models are also the same. Therefore, for the model validation, experiments are carried out on a commercially available tubular module for removal of thiophene from n-heptane/thiophene model gasoline. Furthermore, the experimental results from the literature for the ethanol/water separation are also used for model validation. The mathematical model is successfully validated in both cases. Since the performance of membrane modules also depends on different dimensional parameters related to module geometry, the performances of the hollow fiber module are determined by varying these parameters. Simulations show that lower membrane area, lower length/diameter ratio of module, higher module porosity and lower fiber radius leads to improvement in the module performances. Furthermore, the performance of module is compared for both co-current and counter-current flow arrangements, which shows that the values of average fluxes are higher for counter-current flow arrangement. These results suggest that for given conditions, counter-current hollow fiber module is a better option than the co-current hollow fiber module. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent experiments showed that sulfidation of nanoscopic zinc oxide particles leads to an outward growth and the formation of voids inside the particles. In this work, we derive a micro-scale model to describe this phenomenon. The model accounts for nucleation and growth of voids inside the particles, diffusion of Zn and O through the product layer, and deposition of the solid product at the particle surface as a result of the reaction between ZnO and H2S. The model is thus opposite to the well known shrinking core model where an inward growth of the product layer is assumed. To explore the effect of the outward growth on the dynamics of a packed bed adsorber the micro-scale model is combined with a macro-scale model that accounts for intra-pellet diffusion and convection along the packed bed. In the limit of fast nucleation and growth of voids inside the zinc oxide particles, the micro-scale model shows a qualitatively similar conversion profile to the shrinking core model, while when nucleation controls an inflection point in conversion profile is found. On the macro-scale, the outward growth can cause the clogging of pores inside the pellets which prevents the pellets from reaching full conversion. This leads to shorter breakthrough times of the packed bed due to the sealing of unreacted zinc oxide. Our results thus provide a possible explanation of the incomplete conversion of zinc oxide in packed beds.",2019,66,11,ED9BY,2019/07/03

This is compared with the conventional batch extraction in parallel. Continuous operation of a process involving liquid liquid extraction and then two-phase separation is achieved instantly. For the latter a micro-scale separator is used. Compared with batch extraction, the segmented micro-flow extraction process shows order-of-magnitude faster extraction times, higher extraction ability for Co, lower extraction for Ni, and then a better selectivity between Co and Ni at industrial-matching concentration. Regular columnar slugs are observed at low flow rates and found to be a Gaussian function of the flow rates. Matched in and outlet flows indicates that extraction in micro-flow is dependent on mass transfer by molecular diffusion. Extraction efficiency is enhanced by the internal circulation flow generated within slugs. Additionally, the characteristic parameters, overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L)alpha and overall mass transfer coefficient k(L), are measured to determine the mass transfer performance. Compared with batch, much higher k(L)alpha. of Co (0.26-0.017 s(-1)) and smaller of Ni (0.053-0.013 s(-1)) are investigated in CFI.

In this paper we report on the fabrication of fully transparent TNT arrays formed by complete self-organizing electrochemical anodization of metallic Ti thin layers deposited on the FTO glass substrate by using electron beam evaporation and/or magnetron sputtering. It is clearly shown for the first time that the quality of the deposited titanium film (e.g. amount and size of pinholes) governs its adherence to the substrate and subsequently the anodization process itself. Mechanical properties of the deposited Ti films were investigated by tribology experiments. The main difference between the sputtered and evaporated titanium layers are the lower film density and considerably higher amount of pinholes of the latter. The grown TNT films were further characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The sputtered layers overperformed the evaporated layers by 20% when applied for DSSC. An even greater difference was observed in the case of aqueous electrolyte based PEC-WS, where the sputtered layers showed five times higher activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between the ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and dynamics. We build on previous studies to highlight the role of viscosity contrast in determining the morphology of mantle plumes and provide detailed visualizations and quantitative information on the convection phenomenon. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection regimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and plate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume structures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the perfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is systematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the bottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure. As the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is observed from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes, accompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing. In the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into intermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume hot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (1/300), the regime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we observe for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with cellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes. We use experimental data to quantify these morphological changes and mixing dynamics of the plumes at different regimes of U.

Islets (150) were co-transplanted, with or without human MAPCs (2.5 x 10(5)) as separate or composite pellets, under the kidney capsule of syngeneic alloxan-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Blood glucose levels were frequently monitored and IPGTTs were carried out. Grafts and serum were harvested at 2 and 5 weeks after transplantation to assess outcome. Human MAPCs produced high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the induction of neo-angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay.

Recent findings Epigenetic drugs developed for cancer have been investigated in vitro, ex vivo and in clinical trials as interventions aimed at reversing HIV latency and depleting the amount of virus that persists on antiretroviral therapy. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors induced HIV expression in patients on antiretroviral therapy but did not reduce the frequency of infected cells. Other interventions that may accelerate the decay of latently infected cells, in the presence or absence of latency-reversing therapy, are now being explored. These include apoptosis-promoting agents, nonhistone deacetylase inhibitor compounds to reverse HIV latency and immunotherapy interventions to enhance antiviral immunity such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and Toll-like receptor agonists. Summary A curative strategy in HIV will likely need to both reduce the amount of virus that persists on antiretroviral therapy and improve anti-HIV immune surveillance.

The oxidation of sulfide by chemolithotrophic sulfide oxidation bacteria can produce elemental sulfur, an important chemical material. A membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) has been successfully implemented and demonstrated for enhanced sulfide oxidation and sulfur production, owning to its counter-diffusion design of oxygen supply. In this work, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the sulfide oxidation and sulfur production in the MABR in the presence of residual organics in the influent. The model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data from the long-term operation of the sulfide-oxidation MABR at different operational stages. The results suggested that the developed model could satisfactorily describe sulfide oxidation, sulfur production, sulfate accumulation and organics conversion in the MABR. The modelling results indicated that with the optimal combinations of sulfide loading and oxygen pressure, over 90% of sulfide removal and over 75% of sulfur recovery could be achieved. The sulfide oxidation and sulfur production would also be affected by the biofilm area to reactor volume (A/V) ratio in the MABR, with high A/V ratio might deteriorate the sulfur production efficiency depending on the oxygen pressure applied.

Three composites were prepared namely AC/Ce, AC/Fe, and AC/Ce/Fe. The composites were investigated for the simultaneous desulfurization of thiophene, benzothiophene (BT), and dibenzothiophene (DBT) in a model fuel. The surface structures, morphologies, and pore structures were characterized. The unloaded AC had the highest surface area and pore volume of 460.27 m(2)/g and 0.71 cm(3)/g respectively. Moreover, the unloaded AC showed the highest surface oxygen-containing groups but performed the least in desulfurization. The adsorptive desulfurization efficiency followed the order: AC < AC/Fe < AC/Ce < AC/Ce/Fe. The AC/Ce/Fe performed the best in the adsorption of thiophene (31%), BT (30%), and DBT (75%) despite having the least surface area and pore volume of 430.44 m(2)/g and 0.64 cm(3)/g. All the adsorbents showed a greater affinity to the large size DBT. Batch and column experiments carried out using AC/Ce/Fe revealed a high absorptive capacity and breakthrough for DBT i.e. 16 mg/g. The kinetic data showed a synergistic effect of surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion occurring concurrently, and the results complied with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption results are well fitted to the Freundlich isotherm indicating a heterogeneous adsorption process. Thermal regeneration experiments carried out on AC/Ce/Fe showed stable efficiency in the adsorptive desulfurization after regeneration cycles. The regeneration properties displayed by the adsorbent could enhance its practical application in an industrial setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,95,7,EE5HL,2018/07/04

Health care, education, employment, independent living, and community engagement have been identified as areas of concern. However, relatively little research has been done to understand the experiences, perceptions, and needs of individuals with cerebral palsy as they transition toward adulthood. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the transition experiences, perceptions, and needs of young adults with cerebral palsy living in one state in the southeastern United States. Methods: Focus groups with nine young adults with cerebral palsy (19-34 years) were conducted. The focus group interview explored the preparation for transition and experiences navigating adulthood. The audio-recorded groups were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Young adults with cerebral palsy identified numerous challenges associated with navigating adulthood. The main themes were: 1) being thrust into adulthood; 2) navigating systems and services; 3) understanding and managing my body; and 4) dealing with stereotypes and prejudice. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to transition with a focus on building capacity and empowerment. To navigate complex systems of care, ""navigators"" or ""facilitators"" are needed. Additionally, practitioners and service providers in adult systems need further education about cerebral palsy.

Recent studies indicate that adropin, a newly identified peptide, participates in cardiovascular health through the regulation of several metabolic events including angiogenesis and blood flow. In this study, we aimed to determine the relation of adropin with biochemical and radiologic parameters which reflect ED such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), endothelin 1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) along with the routine biochemical measurements in patients recently diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: Fasting blood samples from 110 patients with MetS diagnosed according to the NCEP ATP III-2005 criteria were collected to measure the concentrations of adropin and other parameters including the lipid profile, insulin and glucose. Serum NOx concentrations were determined by measuring NO2 plus NO3. FMD test was performed by ultrasonography, and patients were stratified as FMD (+) or (-). Data were compared between these two subgroups and also with matching healthy controls (n = 50). Biochemical data were evaluated using Student's t or MannWhitney U tests. Results: Fifty-nine subjects had ED (+) and the remaining 101 subjects were ED (-). In the first group, adropin levels were significantly lower than the latter (2.13 +/- 1.05 vs. 3.41 +/- 1.63 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001) and independently associated with FMD positivity as assessed by the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Low adropin level in circulation is related to ED and has a close association with FMD.

The present study prospectively analysed trajectories of depressive symptoms in adults during the first 5 years of living with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and to examine how they affect diabetes outcome. We reanalysed data from a prospective multicentre observational cohort study including 313 adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. At baseline and in annual postal surveys over 5 consecutive years, we gathered patient characteristics and behavioural and psychosocial data (e.g. Symptom Checklist-90-R [SCL-90-R]). Medical data (e.g. HbA(1c) levels) was obtained from the treating physicians. We applied growth mixture modelling (GMM) to identify distinct trajectories of depression over time. Five years after diagnosis, 7.8% (n = 20) of patients were moderately depressed and 10.2% (n = 26) were severely depressed. GMM statistics identified three possible models of trajectories (class 1, 'no depressive symptoms'; class 2, 'worsening depressive symptoms that improve after 2 years'; class 3, 'worsening depressive symptoms'). Severity of depression symptoms at baseline (subscale of the SCL-90-R questionnaire) significantly predicted membership of classes 2 and 3 vs class 1. After 5 years, higher HbA(1c) values were detected in class 3 patients (mean = 8.2%, 66 mmol/mol) compared with class 1 and class 2 (both: mean = 7.2%, 55 mmol/mol).

The catalytic performance over MAl2O4 is poor but can be improved significantly by incorporating Pd into the lattice, resulting in NO conversion over Co-AlPd, Zn-AlPd and Cu-AlPd catalysts of approximately 95%, 90.5% and 84%, respectively, in the presence of 2% O-2 at a low temperature range of 100-350 degrees C. Both the pure and Pd-doped aluminate spinel catalysts showed the same sequences with respect to activity: Co-Al > Zn-Al > Cu-Al and Co-AIPd > Zn-AlPd > Cu-AlPd, indicating that the selection of divalent metal M is of essential importance in designing spinel catalysts and in modifying their SCR performance.

During their operation, 3D objects are formed by repeating cycles of drawing a UV-curable resin with inkjet nozzles and then solidifying it with UV irradiation. In this study, the activity performed by a 3D UV inkjet printer was simulated by spin casting a 33 mu m thick layer of UV-curable resin (containing diurethanedimethacrylate and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone compounds mixed at a weight ratio of 99:1) onto a Si wafer followed by photopolymerization for 2 s at a UV irradiation of 10 mW cm(-2). Afterwards, the second resin layer with a thickness of 33 mu m was spun-cast onto the first layer and photopolymerized under the same conditions. The conversion distribution of C= C bonds in the UV-curable resin was investigated via confocal laser Ramanmicroscopy and numerical calculations, which took into account the kinetics of photopolymerization and oxygen inhibition reactions. The confocal laser Raman microscopy technique provided a unique distribution of the C=C bond conversion across the film depth. Thus, the conversion magnitude at a depth of 0 mu m was zero and increased to 0.2 at 6 mu m. Afterwards, the slope of the conversion distribution plot became moderate until the conversion reached the value of 0.43 at a film depth of 28 mu m. Between the film depths of 28 and 38 mu m, the conversion remained constant with a variation not exceeding 0.03. After that, the conversion value increased again, reaching the magnitude of 0.48 at a depth of 50 mu m and remained constant in the region between 50 and 56 mu m (with a variation not exceeding 0.04). At higher depths, the graph slope became moderate again, and the conversion value increased gradually to 0.51 at 66 mu m, after which the silicon wafer was reached. As a result, two different plateaus were observed on the conversion distribution plot: between 28 and 38 mu m and between 50 and 56 mu m (the corresponding conversion variation in these regions was below 0.05). The obtained experimental data were in good agreement with the results of numerical calculations, which attributed the existence of the two plateaus on the plot of the C=C bond conversion distribution to the formation of an oxygen-lean point. In addition, the effects of the UV intensity, irradiation time, lamination time, photoinitiator concentration, and concentration of dissolved oxygen on the oxygen concentration and conversion distributions across the depth direction have been examined. The obtained results revealed that the increases in the UV intensity, irradiation time, and photoinitiator concentration as well as the decrease in the initial dissolved oxygen concentration effectively increased the conversion of C=C bonds in the resin film and decreased the thickness of an unpolymerized layer.",2020,66,7,EE4EV,2018/11/10

In this study we report, to our knowledge for the first time, upon the ontogenic onset of behavioural fever in zebrafish (Danio redo) larvae. For this, zebrafish larvae (from first feeding to juveniles) were placed in a continuous thermal gradient providing the opportunity to select their preferred temperature. The novel thermal preference aquarium was based upon a continuous vertical column system and allows for non-invasive observation of larvae vertical distribution under isothermal (T-R at 28 degrees C) and thermal gradient conditions (T-CH: 28-32 degrees C). Larval thermal preference was assessed under both conditions with or without an immersion challenge, in order to detect the onset of the behavioural fever response. Our results defined the onset of the dsRNA induced behavioural fever at 18-20 days post fertilization (dpf). Significant differences were observed in dsRNA challenged larvae, which prefer higher temperatures (1-4 degrees C increase) throughout the experimental period as compared to non-challenged larvae. In parallel we measured the abundance of antiviral transcripts; viperin, gig2, irf7, trim25 and Mxb mRNAs in dsRNA challenged larvae under both thermal regimes: T-R and T-Ch. Significant increases in the abundance of all measured transcripts were recorded under thermal choice conditions signifying that thereto-coupling and the resultant enhancement of the immune response to dsRNA challenge occurs from 18 dpf onwards in the zebrafish. The results are of importance as they identify a key developmental stage where the neuro-immune interface matures in the zebrafish likely providing increased resistance to viral infection.

Part 1: Two-zone reactor,English,Article,"This work reports the results of an experimental investigation on densified zone formation in a membrane fluidized bed reactor using combined pressure fluctuation and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements. A pseudo 2D experimental setup was used, where porous plates on the back plate of column mimicked gas extraction through flat vertically inserted membranes. The maximum in the standard deviation of pressure fluctuations, commonly employed to indicate the transition to turbulent fluidization, shifted to lower fluidization velocities with an increase in the fraction of fluidizing gas being extracted. Flow visualization showed that this result is connected to the onset of stable densified zone formation, which occurred at progressively lower fluidization velocities as the gas extraction fraction was increased. It has also been found that the extent of densified zones quantified using instantaneous particle velocity maps collected by Ply increases with increasing gas extraction rates. This effect became larger for smaller particles. Results have therefore shown that the peak in pressure fluctuations in fluidized beds with gas extraction through flat vertical membranes indicates the onset of densified zones formation rather than turbulent fluidization. Such densified zones can have substantial detrimental effects (such as induced mass transfer limitations, gas bypass etc.) on the reactor performance and can be identified via pressure measurements, as illustrated in this work.

We aimed to find out whether mitochondrial measures are downregulated in obesity also in isolated adipocytes. We studied young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant (n = 14, intrapair difference Delta BMI >= 3 kg/m(2)) and concordant (n = 5, Delta BMI < 3 kg/m(2)) for BMI, identified from ten birth cohorts of 22- to 36-year-old Finnish twins. Abdominal body fat distribution (MRI), liver fat content (magnetic resonance spectroscopy), insulin sensitivity (OGTT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum lipids and adipokines were measured. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were obtained to analyse the transcriptomics patterns of the isolated adipocytes as well as of the whole adipose tissue. Mitochondrial DNA transcript levels in adipocytes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blots of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels in adipocytes were performed in obese and lean unrelated individuals. The heavier (BMI 29.9 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2)) co-twins of the discordant twin pairs had more subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat and were more insulin resistant (p < 0.01 for all measures) than the lighter (24.1 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) co-twins. Altogether, 2538 genes in adipocytes and 2135 in adipose tissue were significantly differentially expressed (nominal p < 0.05) between the co-twins. Pathway analysis of these transcripts in both isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue revealed that the heavier co-twins displayed reduced expression of genes relating to mitochondrial pathways, a result that was replicated when analysing the pathways behind the most consistently downregulated genes in the heavier co-twins (in at least 12 out of 14 pairs). Consistently upregulated genes in adipocytes were related to inflammation. We confirmed that mitochondrial DNA transcript levels (12S RNA, 16S RNA, COX1, ND5, CYTB), expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein transcripts and a major mitochondrial regulator PGC-1 alpha (also known as PPARGC1A) were reduced in the heavier co-twins' adipocytes (p < 0.05). OXPHOS protein levels of complexes I and III in adipocytes were lower in obese than in lean individuals. Subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes in obesity show global expressional downregulation of oxidative pathways, mitochondrial transcripts and OXPHOS protein levels and upregulation of inflammatory pathways.

CrustinPm1 inhibits only Gram-positive bacteria, while crustinPm7 acts against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This work aims to characterize the molecular properties of recombinant crustinPm1 and crustinPm7, and the regulatory pathways of these two crustins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that crustinPm1 contained 40.81% alpha-helix and 22.34% beta-sheet, whereas crustinPm7 is made up of 32.86% alpha-helix and 27.53% beta-sheet. CrustinPm1 and crustinPm7 bound to phosphatidic acid (PA) with positive cooperativity of Hill slope (H) >2, indicating that at least two molecules of crustins bind with one PA molecule. It is worth noting that both crustins bound to PA with significantly higher affinity than to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We speculate that crustin might also achieve antimicrobial activity by targeting PA, a signaling lipid. Regulatory pathways of crustinPm1 and crustinPm7 were investigated by knockdown of PmRelish and PmMyD88. This study demonstrated that crustinPm1 is mediated through the Toll signaling pathway, while crustinPm7 is regulated via both Toll and Imd pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant global shift in neonatal transcriptome occurs within first week post-birth, in contrast to dams, with an upregulation of 717 genes. Global pathway analysis of the transcriptome revealed 110 differentially expressed immune-related genes, such as, complement, MHCII, chemokine receptors, defensins and cytokines, at birth. The signaling molecules (LAX1, BLK) and transcription factors (GATA3, FOXP3) are expressed at high levels. High expression of GATA3 transcription factor at birth seems to skew the neonatal immune response towards TH2 type. The high levels of T-cell signaling molecules, CD3G and CD3D, at birth are important in neonatal T cell development. Unlike adults, IGKC expression is high in the neonates where IGKV12 is preferentially expressed at birth. But IGLC is predominant in both neonates and adult where IGLV3.4 is preferentially expressed in B cells at birth. Both IGHM and IGHD are expressed at birth and IGHM achieves adult levels by day 7. This is followed by IGHA and IGHG expression 14-28 days post-birth. Importantly, preferential expression of IGHV1S1(BF4E9) and longest IGHD2(D(H)2) genes that encode immunoglobulin with exceptionally long CDR3H at birth indicates their critical role, as B cell antigen receptor, in the B cell development via idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions. The transcriptome signatures described here permit assessment bovine neonatal immunocompetence. Bovine neonates acquire innate and IgM-mediated humoral immunocompetence within first week post-birth.

During their operation, 3D objects are formed by repeating cycles of drawing a UV-curable resin with inkjet nozzles and then solidifying it with UV irradiation. In this study, the activity performed by a 3D UV inkjet printer was simulated by spin casting a 33 mu m thick layer of UV-curable resin (containing diurethanedimethacrylate and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone compounds mixed at a weight ratio of 99:1) onto a Si wafer followed by photopolymerization for 2 s at a UV irradiation of 10 mW cm(-2). Afterwards, the second resin layer with a thickness of 33 mu m was spun-cast onto the first layer and photopolymerized under the same conditions. The conversion distribution of C= C bonds in the UV-curable resin was investigated via confocal laser Ramanmicroscopy and numerical calculations, which took into account the kinetics of photopolymerization and oxygen inhibition reactions. The confocal laser Raman microscopy technique provided a unique distribution of the C=C bond conversion across the film depth. Thus, the conversion magnitude at a depth of 0 mu m was zero and increased to 0.2 at 6 mu m. Afterwards, the slope of the conversion distribution plot became moderate until the conversion reached the value of 0.43 at a film depth of 28 mu m. Between the film depths of 28 and 38 mu m, the conversion remained constant with a variation not exceeding 0.03. After that, the conversion value increased again, reaching the magnitude of 0.48 at a depth of 50 mu m and remained constant in the region between 50 and 56 mu m (with a variation not exceeding 0.04). At higher depths, the graph slope became moderate again, and the conversion value increased gradually to 0.51 at 66 mu m, after which the silicon wafer was reached. As a result, two different plateaus were observed on the conversion distribution plot: between 28 and 38 mu m and between 50 and 56 mu m (the corresponding conversion variation in these regions was below 0.05). The obtained experimental data were in good agreement with the results of numerical calculations, which attributed the existence of the two plateaus on the plot of the C=C bond conversion distribution to the formation of an oxygen-lean point. In addition, the effects of the UV intensity, irradiation time, lamination time, photoinitiator concentration, and concentration of dissolved oxygen on the oxygen concentration and conversion distributions across the depth direction have been examined. The obtained results revealed that the increases in the UV intensity, irradiation time, and photoinitiator concentration as well as the decrease in the initial dissolved oxygen concentration effectively increased the conversion of C=C bonds in the resin film and decreased the thickness of an unpolymerized layer.",2019,310,13,EC3HG,2019/05/27

Various immune signaling pathways and effectors have been shown to mediate a certain degree of defense specificity against different Plasmodium species. A key pattern recognition receptor of the Anopheles gambiae immune system is the fibrinogen domain-containing immunolectin FBN9, which has been shown to be transcriptonally induced by Plasmodium infection, and to mediate defense against both rodent and human malaria parasites and bacteria. Here we have further studied the defense specificity of FBN9 using a transgenic approach, in which FBN9 is overexpressed in the fat body tissue after a blood meal through a vitellogenin promoter. Interestingly, the Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes showed increased resistance only to the rodent parasite P. berghei, and not to the human parasite P. falciparum, pointing to differences in the mosquito's defense mechanisms against the two parasite species. The Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes were also more resistant to infection with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and showed increased longevity when infected with P. berghei. Our study points to the importance of both experimentally depleting and enriching candidate anti-Plasmodium effectors in functional studies in order to ascertain their suitability for the development of transgenic mosquito based malaria control strategies.

Additionally, the authors laid out a roadmap for the integration of microfluidics and stem cell biology as a holistic approach for the development of novel in vitro BBB platforms. Expert opinion: Development of effective CNS drugs has been hindered by the lack of reliable strategies to mimic the BBB and cerebrovascular impairments in vitro.

The results show that coupling of CrCl3 and H3PO4 as a mixed catalyst has a positive synergistic catalytic effect on glucose conversion to LA compared with single CrCl3 or H3PO4 catalyst. Both the reaction time and temperature have strong effect on glucose conversion and LA formation, the highest LA yield of 54.24% was obtained from 100% glucose conversion at 170 degrees C for 240 min. Furthermore, a simplified kinetic model was developed to describe the behavior of glucose conversion and LA formation based on the pseudo homogeneous first-order model, and the results show that this model is in good agreement with the experiment data. The reaction rate constants for glucose decomposition, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) conversion, and LA formation are all increased with elevated temperature, the activation energies for glucose dehydration into HMF and HMF rehydration to LA were 65.4 and 60.6 kJ/mol, respectively, significantly lower than previous reports in the measure of single homogeneous Bronsted acid or Lewis acids.

The materials were characterized by a number of techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, photoluminescence technique, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The photocatalyst was employed to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. Among the prepared samples, the Fe3O4/BiOI with molar ratio of 1:4 (FB-4) heterojunction showed the best photocatalytic activity. The optimal dose of FB-4 was 1.0 g/L. The catalytic degradation also showed a dependence on initial pH, and the maximal degradation efficiency was obtained at pH 9.0. The presence of nitrate and bicarbonate stimulated BPA degradation by Fe3O4/BiOI at low concentrations but inhibited the degradation at high concentrations. HA inhibited the degradation at all concentrations. The photogenerated reactive species determined by free radicals trapping experiments revealed that the photodegradation of BPA over Fe3O4/BiOI under visible light was dominated by direct hole and hydroxyl radicals rather than oxidation by superoxide radicals. The disappearance of BPA as well as the formation of its intermediates/products were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and possible photocatalytic degradation pathways were proposed. Cycling test showed that the magnetic Fe3O4/BiOI composite could be easily recycled after five cycles and separated well by an external magnetic field, and could maintain an excellent photocatalytic activity on BPA degradation.

The photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of gas-phase n-decane was studied using a micro-meso-structured-photoreactor irradiated by simulated solar light, consisting of chambers and channels mechanically engraved in an acrylic slab. The network of chambers and channels is sealed with a borosilicate slab, allowing a good light penetration through the entire reactor depth. A sheet of cellulose acetate (CA) coated, in one side, with TiO2-P25 was assembled between the two slabs, allowing high spatial illumination homogeneity over the catalyst surface. The P25 thin film was in contact with the air stream flowing in the network. The reactor contains 1.95 g of TiO2 in contact with the air stream per liter of reactor volume and the illuminated catalyst surface area, in contact with the gas phase, per reactor volume was calculated to be 349 m(2) m(-3), which is similar to 1.4 times higher than that obtained for an annular photoreactor packed with CA monolithic structures coated with TiO2-P25. The PCO reaction rate, r(dec), was assessed under different experimental conditions: amount of TiO2 supported in CA sheets, n-decane feed concentration, feed flow rate, relative humidity and UV irradiance. The highest r(dec) value (0.82 mu mol min(-1)) was achieved when the following conditions were employed: mTiO(2) = 75 mg, C-dec,C-feed = 131 x 10(-2) mol m(-3), Q(feed) = 220 cm(3) min(-1) and I = 38.4 W m(-2). The maximum reactivity of photocatalyst in combination with the photoreactor was 6.93 x 10(-4) mol m(reactor)(-3) s(-1), which is a 21.4 fold increase when compared with the annular photoreactor, highlighting the enhancement of mass and photons transfer.

This ootaxon is diagnosed by the following unique combination of characters: spherical eggs 34-39 mm in diameter, 660 760 gm thick eggshell, shell unit height-to-width ratio of 3.15:1-5.5:1, and domed shell units. Estimated egg mass indicates that the egg-laying adult likely possessed a carapace 35.0-54.4 cm in length. Similarities between T. zelenitskyae oosp. nov. and Adocus sp. eggs, along with comparable body size, suggest that this taxon might have produced MOR 710. One egg exhibits abnormal multilayered eggshell, likely resulting from prolonged egg retention by the female turtle. At least five of these eggs, including the multilayered specimen, preserve embryonic remains that demonstrate a late stage of embryonic development. This suggests that death occurred just prior to hatching. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,36,9,EC1WK,2017/01/06

The process to prepare this catalyst has three steps as follows. For the first step, Fe-dispersed CNH (Fe-CNH) was synthesized by a gas-injected arc-in-water method. For the second step, the oxidation treatment in diluted CO2 or in air was performed on Fe-CNH to transform Fe nanoparticles dispersed in Fe-CNH to Fe3O4 or Fe2O3, respectively. For third step, Fe3O4-dispersed CNH (Fe3O4-CNH) or Fe2O3-dispersed CNH (Fe2O3-CNH) was co-calcined with Ca (NO3)(2), resulting to the formation of Ca2Fe2O5-CNH. The powdery catalysts of Ca2Fe2O5-CNH can be recovered by magnetic field for recycled use. In the transesterification experiment, tricaprylin was converted to methyl caprylate. The reaction rate of this transesterification using Ca2Fe2O5-CNH catalysts was obviously higher than using conventional CaO catalyst. Also CNH supporting CaO without including Fe (CaO-CNH) was prepared, and this catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity for this transesterification. However, CaO-CNH did not have the property for magnetic recovery. Among the catalysts prepared here, Ca2Fe2O5-CNH prepared using Fe3O4-CNH as precursor exhibited the highest reaction rate for the transesterification.

This study presented a detailed work on direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction (i.e. Cr (VI) is reduced with organics as electron donor directly) by anaerobic sludge through both batch and long-term experiments. Effects of pH and initial Cr (VI) concentrations on direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction activity were evaluated. The highest direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction rate was achieved at pH 8.0 at 104 mg Cr (VI)/g MLVSS/d (MLVSS: mixed liquor volatile suspended solids), corresponding to the highest protein release (124 mg/g MLVSS) and cell viability (71%). In contrast, the direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction rates were 46, 70 and 82 mg Cr (VI)/g MLVSS/d, respectively, at pH 6.0, 7.0 and 9.0. Also, the direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction activity decreased by 74% when initial Cr (VI) concentration increased from 10 mg/L to 50 mg/L. The contribution of chemical adsorption to Cr (VI) removal was found to be negligible, whereas biosorption played a role in Cr (VI) removal although its role was insignificant. Indirect Cr (VI) bio-reduction (i.e. Cr (VI) is chemically reduced by sulfide produced from biological sulfate reduction) rate (990 mg Cr (VI)/g MLVSS/d) was faster than that (210 mg Cr (VI)/g MLVSS/d) of direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction, indicating that indirect Cr (VI) bio-reduction would dominate the Cr (VI) bioreduction pathway if both Cr (VI) and sulfate were present. The direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction was then successfully demonstrated in an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor, where the Cr (VI) was completely removed with a Cr (VI) removal rate of 1.0 mg Cr (VI)/L/h. 454 pyrosequencing results revealed that direct Cr (VI) bio-reduction related genera were Desulfovibrio, Ochrobactrum and Anaerovorax.

Recent studies postulated a possible connection between plasmatic hypercoagulability and progression of fibrosis. The aim of the study was to investigate disorders of the coagulation system in patients with chronic hepatitis C having different extent of hepatic fibrosis well defined by liver histology. A total of 62 patients with chronic hepatitis C were recruited and categorized into 2 groups according to their histological fibrosis stage : mild/moderate fibrosis group (F0-F3 group, n = 30) and extensive fibrosis/cirrhosis group (F4-F6 group, n = 32). The control group consisted of 31 healthy individuals. The following hemostatic assays were evaluated: antithrombin III (AT), protein C (PC) activity, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen as well as conventional liver function test. The PC level exhibited a significant reduction in both patient groups when compared to the normal control group (89.25% +/- 10.05% and 48.33% +/- 15.86% vs 111.86 +/- 10.90; P < .001 and P < .001). The PC was found to be the strongest associated factor to histological fibrosis stage (r = -.834; P < .0001). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that AT (P = .003) and PC (P = .0001) were the most important factors associated with advanced fibrosis. The PC (P = .001) was found to be the only predictor of mild fibrosis. In conclusion, PC deficiency occurs in an early stage of liver fibrosis. The severity of deficiency is proportional to extent of fibrosis.

The patients were categorized into three groups based on their documented preoperative potassium concentrations. Hypokalemia was defined as serum potassium concentration < 4 mmol/L and hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L. The values within the range of 4.0-5.5 mmol/L were considered as normokalemia and used as the control group. Statistical analyses included Chi-square test, analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression to estimate the risk of MACE within 30 days of surgery.

Results show that pH plays an important role in the formation of passive films on steel rebars. In non carbonated cement extract solution, corrosion behaviors of CS and Cr modified steel vary slightly, and Cr addition brings down the amount of defects in passive film. In carbonated cement extract solution, pitting potential shifts negatively as pH value decreases. Polarization resistance declines and the density of the current carrier in the passive film increases. With Cr content increasing, corrosion current density declines; pitting potential, polarization resistance and passivation range are magnified. Besides, the effect of Cr is more significant in lower pH. The good-to-poor sequence of corrosion resistance is: 5Cr > 3Cr > 1.5Cr > CS, and 5Cr steel possesses the best corrosion resistance.

The adsorption data in the absence and presence of Ca2+ satisfactorily fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The phosphate adsorption in the absence of Ca2+ showed little pH dependence in the range of 4-6, but it decreased sharply with the pH increase at pH above 6. The phosphate adsorption in the presence of Ca2+ showed little pH dependence in the range of 4-9. The mechanism for phosphate adsorption onto HZO mainly followed the inner-sphere complexing mechanism, and the surface chloride and hydroxyl groups played the key role in the phosphate adsorption. The presence of Ca2+ significantly enhanced the adsorption of phosphate on HZO over a pH range of 6-9, and the formation of Ca2+-phosphate species in the phosphate/calcium solution such as CaHPO40 and the formation of phosphate-bridged ternary complexes ( Zr-P-Ca) on the HZO surface played the key role in the enhancement of phosphate adsorption by coexisting Ca2+.

The model includes the rigorous description of the hydrodynamics, radiation transfer, mass transport and chemical reaction rate based on a mechanistic kinetic model. Possible existence of dead and recirculation zones has been identified from the flow field, showing a non-uniform flow through the reactor domain. The theoretical laminar profile is not reached due to the short length of the annular core and the departure from the ideal models has been quantified. The predicted velocity field has been experimentally validated with good agreement by injecting a tracer. The radiation field was simulated for slurry TiO2 suspensions with concentrations between 0.005 and 5 g.L-1, showing an optimum catalyst loading around 0.1-0.2 g.L-1. Above this value, the increase in the absorption of radiation is negligible, whereas a more non-uniform radiation profile develops, keeping the most external regions of the reactor in the dark. The results of photocatalytic activity, using methanol oxidation as test reaction, showed good agreement between model predictions and experimental data, with errors between 2% and 10% depending on the catalyst concentration. The successful validation confirms not only the scientific background of the model, but also supports its applicability for engineering purposes in the design and optimization of large scale photocatalytic reactor to overcome some of limitations hindering the industrial development of this technology.

Depolymerization of lignin is one of the most important factors for utilizing the basic frameworks of phenylpropanoids. Lignin is extractable from lignocellulosic biomass using acetone-water binary solution. Therefore, the simultaneous extraction and depolymerization of lignin under high temperature and high pressure from Japanese cedar was examined. Prior to the extraction process, cedar was treated with 50 wt% formic acid at 175 degrees C for the saccharification of hemicellulose and part of cellulose which could be contaminants in resin material. Next, the lignin extraction was conducted using 30 wt% of acetone at the higher""temperature of 295 degrees C and 0.82 g/(g-lignin in material) was obtained. The curing property of the obtained sample was evaluated by differential thermal analysis and the detected exothermic energy during resinification was 18.2 mu V/mg. In addition, it was confirmed by visual observation that the obtained sample resinified uniformly by heating at 150 degrees C. Thus, the effective production method of usable lignin-based resin was developed. Lastly, this treatment method was applied to eucalyptus, another type of lignocellulosic biomass, and was validated as effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the mixed graphene dioxide (GO) was reduced during PAHD coating of TiO2-GO nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed TiO2 presented as a mixture phase of anatase, rutile and brookite in the TiO2-rGO nanocomposites. UV- vis absorption spectra of TiO2-rGO nanocomposites indicated that mixing rGO into TiO2 particles could reduce band gap energy, thereby enhancing utilization efficiency of visible light. Photocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposites was measured by the degradation of three pharmaceuticals under UV and visible light irradiation, including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole. TiO2-rGO nanocomposites exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activities as compared to pure TiO2, and were strongly affected by the amount of rGO in the catalysts. While photocatalysis with 2.7% rGO achieved 54% degradation of carbamazepine, 81% of ibuprofen, and 92% of sulfamethoxazole after 180 min UV irradiation, the mineralization rates of the pharmaceuticals were similar between 52% and 59%. The photocatalytic oxidation of pharmaceuticals by the prepared nanocomposites followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. There was an obvious positive correlation between degradation rate constant and quantum flux for both UV and visible light, with correlation coefficient of 0.991.

All KF-PDA-GO fibers not only have greatly improved surface activity and UV resistance, overcoming the two intractable disadvantages of KFs, but also show outstanding thermal resistance and higher tensile properties including tensile strength, modulus, elongation and break energy. For the new fiber (KF-PDA-GO3) prepared with the optimum conditions, its surface free energy increases 54%, meanwhile the retention of tensile strength after 168 h-UV irradiation is as high as 93.4%, almost the best value among the latest modified KF fibers reported. Different failure modes are found between original and modified KF fibers through intensively discussing the morphological and chemical structures of fibers. This investigation provides a novel and facile method to develop new KF fibers with higher integrated performances, especially outstanding surface activity, UV resistance, thermal and mechanical properties.

It was found that the sorption capacity increases with the increasing phase contact time and concentration of the initial solution. It was found that biochar removes more efficiently heavy metal ions from aqueous"" solutions than the activated carbon. Sorption kinetic data provide a complex mechanism of sorption and better fit of the pseudo second order model than the pseudo first order and the intraparticle diffusion ones. In the second stage the desorption of the above mentioned heavy metal ions from the biochar and commercial activated carbon was conducted. It was proved that biochar has excellent properties and can be used as a sorbent of multi-use 0.1 M HNO3 was the best eluent for desorption of heavy metal ions in the sorption/desorption studies in the third stage. In Order to characterize the mechanism of sorption/desorption for both biochar and activated carbon, the Brunauer Emmett Teller surface area was determined and point of zero charge was measured. Moreover, the elemental analysis and the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were applied. The thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric analyses were conducted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of prejudice include harmful health consequences. The Contact Hypothesis has previously shown to promote positive attitudes towards a range of social groups. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of school-based interventions for improving children's attitudes towards disability through contact with people with disabilities. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases. Studies were included if it evaluated an intervention that aimed to improve children's attitudes towards disability and involved either direct (in-person) or indirect (e.g., extended) contact with people with disabilities. Data were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 found significant effects: six used direct contact, two used extended contact, two used parasocial (media-based) contact and one used guided imagined contact. One parasocial contact intervention found no significant effects. Three meta-analyses showed direct contact (d = 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.90) and extended contact (d = 0.61, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.07) improved children's attitudes; there was no evidence for parasocial contact (d = 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 1.40).

In this work, porous carbon beads (PCBs) of around 1.5 mm were synthesized via phase inversion route followed by carbonization. Specially, porous polymeric beads (PPBs) were obtained by injecting of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer solution containing phenolic resins into coagulation bath. The porous structure of PPBs can be adjusted by simply altering the composition of coagulation bath, which further determined the final microstructure of PCBs. Mercury porosimeter, SEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization revealed that the resultant PCBs possess uniform spherical shape, abundant macrospore and high mesoporosity. The sample obtained under the moderate phase inversion condition, i.e. PCBs-2, possesses highest BET surface area (1166 m(2)/g), mesoporous pore volume (0.249 cm(3)/g) and pore size (2.87 nm). To present the removal performance of PCBs for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the adsorption behaviors under static and dynamic conditions were investigated. The static adsorption result indicated that PCBs-2 exhibits the largest adsorption capacities for benzene (1.467 g/g), toluene (1.229 g/g), n-hexane (0.600 g/g) and acetone (0.770 g/g). Dynamic adsorption on thermogravimetric analyzer reveled that PCBs-2 presents higher adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics for benzene vapor. Breakthrough curves obtained from fixed bed on PCBs-2 and commercialized granular activated carbon further confirms the enhanced adsorption capacity was achieved on PCBs-2. After 6 adsorption-desorption cycles, the steady dynamic adsorption capacity can be reserved with negligible change. These results imply that PCBs-2 has great potential as a promising candidate for the abatement of VOCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,307,14,EB3VY,2019/06/04

The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to imipenem of 357 non-duplicated Enterobacter isolates obtained from eight geographically distant tertiary care hospitals in Korea was evaluated. Imipenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacter isolates were genotyped. Additionally, beta-lactamase genes were screened using PCR, and the expression of efflux pump and porin genes was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. A total of 31 isolates (8.7%) were not susceptible to imipenem. Clonal diversity of 17 imipenem-nonsusceptible E. cloacae isolates was demonstrated by multilocus sequence typing. Fourteen imipenem-nonsusceptible E. aerogenes isolates were found to be distantly genetically related by an ERIC-PCR analysis. Expression levels of porin ompD and ompIC35 genes were decreased in all imipenem-nonsusceptible E. cloacae and E. aerogenes isolates. However, only two isolates were found positive for bla(IMP) and bla(VIM) genes, and expression of the efflux pump gene, acrB, was not associated with reduced imipenem susceptibility. Imipenem resistance seems to have occurred independently in most of the imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates in this study, and decreased porin expression was found to be the main mechanism underlying this reduced susceptibility to imipenem.

A case study is carried out, comparing different commonly used signal control strategies with the FITS control approach. The simulation results show that the control system has the potential to improve traffic mobility, compared to all of the tested signal control strategies, due to its ability in generating flexible phase structures and making intelligent timing decisions. In addition, the effects of detector malfunction are also investigated in this study.

The CO2 transformation process is a sequential combination of both water oxidation and CO2 reduction. As these processes can be affected by parameters such as radiant flux intensity and the partial pressures of both CO2 and water vapour, these factors were systematically varied and studied in order to determine the most suitable process conditions for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Based on results from the CO2 photoreduction experiments, a total methane (CH4) yield of 3.450 mu mol g(cat)(-1) was successfully attained over 5GO-OTiO2 after 8 h of reaction time under visible light irradiation. The experimental data obtained was then fitted into the Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface reaction mechanism, wherein both CO2 and H2O adsorbed simultaneously on the photocatalyst surface to form the CH4 product. Regression fitting was performed to determine the kinetic parameters such as reaction rate constant and adsorption equilibrium constants. The reaction rate as well as CO2 and H2O adsorption equilibrium constants were determined to be 84.42 mu mol h(-1), 0.019 bar(-1) and 8.07 bar(-1), respectively. The significantly smaller CO2 adsorption equilibrium constant implied that the adsorption of CO2 was very weak while water strongly adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of Weber number, density ratio and viscosity ratio on the unsteady drag coefficient of drop deformation are studied. It is found that the unsteady term (including density ratio) has the most effect on the unsteady drag coefficient and Weber number secondly. The viscosity ratio has little effect on the unsteady drag coefficient due to low Ohnesorge number. The numerical results confirm that the difference between drag coefficient and standard steady drag coefficient has an approximately linear curve fit with the unsteady parameter for low Weber number.

Expert opinion: Accumulating information of AMPK structure has provided us with deep insight into the molecular basis underlying the regulatory mechanisms, and further discloses several structural domains, which can be served for a target site for computer-based drug design. Molecular docking and simulations provides useful information about the binding sites between potent drugs and AMPK as well as a rational screening format to discover isoform-specific AMPK modulators.

The XRD results showed that cadmium ferrite spinel (CdFe2O4) was the only Cd-hosting product phase in both systems. Both of the iron oxides were found to be efficient in incorporating Cd into the CdFe2O4 spinel structure, but Fe3O4 was more reactive in the Cd incorporated at low temperatures. The weight factions of the crystalline phases in the sintered products were quantified by the Rietveld refinement method, and the transformation ratio (TR) index was used to reveal the Cd incorporation efficiencies of the iron oxides. A TR of 100% was achieved at 850 degrees C, indicating the potential for efficient stabilization of Cd through thermal reactions with iron oxide precursors. The Cd stabilization effects were further assessed by leaching CdFe2O4 and CdO in constant pH (2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) leaching tests. The results revealed the incongruent dissolution of CdFe2O4. The amount of Cd leached from the CdFe2O4 was more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that from the CdO, signifying a highly promising and reliable strategy for Cd stabilization. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to systematically report the roles of different Fe-rich precursors in Cd stabilization mechanism, and indicates the significant reduction of Cd leachability via CdFe2O4 formation.

However, the utility of Ki-67 determination in cytological material and its association to PNET prognosis are under discussion. MethodsWe have retrospectively reviewed all cases of EUS-FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions performed in the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid) between 2006 and 2016. We have analyzed the potential association between the Ki-67 estimation in PNET cytological material and patient outcomes. ResultsWe identified 24 PNET cases. Mean age was 56.8 years and most patients were males (54%). PNETs were mainly located in the head and tail of the pancreas and the mean tumor size was 36 mm. Cell block from cytology was available in 12 cases (50%), and there were 19 G1, 2 G2, and 3 G3 tumors. All cases graded as G2 (2 patients) or G3 (three patients) on cytology were stage IV, and the 19 cases graded as G1 ranged from stages IA to IV. All patients with G2 tumors on cytology died due to PNET. Of the three patients with G3 lesions, two died of disease and the other died 2 months after diagnosis from causes other than PNET. 78% of the patients with G1 tumors are stable and currently being followed-up.

Although cognition is impaired during hypoglycaemia, restoration of euglycaemia after recurrent hypoglycaemia is associated with improved hippocampally mediated memory. Recurrent hypoglycaemia alters glucocorticoid secretion in response to hypoglycaemia; glucocorticoids are well established to regulate hippocampal processes, suggesting a possible mechanism for recurrent hypoglycaemia modulation of subsequent cognition. We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids within the dorsal hippocampus might mediate the impact of recurrent hypoglycaemia on hippocampal cognitive processes. We characterised changes in the dorsal hippocampus at several time points to identify specific mechanisms affected by recurrent hypoglycaemia, using a well-validated 3 day model of recurrent hypoglycaemia either alone or with intrahippocampal delivery of glucocorticoid (mifepristone) and mineralocorticoid (spironolactone) receptor antagonists prior to each hypoglycaemic episode. Recurrent hypoglycaemia enhanced learning and also increased hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptors, serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation, and plasma membrane levels of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Both hippocampus-dependent memory enhancement and the molecular changes were reversed by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment. These results indicate that increased glucocorticoid signalling during recurrent hypoglycaemia produces several changes in the dorsal hippocampus that are conducive to enhanced hippocampus-dependent contextual learning. These changes appear to be adaptive, and in addition to supporting cognition may reduce damage otherwise caused by repeated exposure to severe hypoglycaemia.",2018,157,11,EF1FR,2019/09/23

The unique hierarchical micro-nano structures are studied by scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis. The PVDF aerogel is superhydrophobic, with a water contact angle of 151 degrees, and can almost instantaneously absorb oil. Contributed by the hierarchical micro-nano structure, both surfactant-free and surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion can be effectively separated by the fabricated PVDF aerogel simply under gravity; with good flux and high filtrate purity up to 99.99%. PVDF aerogel also exhibits moderate oil absorption capacity of 3-7g/g and high up-taking rate for various types of oil. Furthermore, we found that PVDF aerogel is highly stable against concentrated alkaline solution owing to its superhydrophobicity. We further investigated the reusability in oil/water separation and oil absorption, as well as the mechanical properties of PVDF aerogel. As a non-crosslinked thermoplastic polymer, PVDF aerogel can be easily recycled, reused and reformed into any shape. This type of aerogel has potential to be used for environmental applications including oil spillage cleanup and oil purification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) studies show that our prepared MISFNPs was superparamagnetic at room temperature. Further, we used the MISFNPs for the removal of Pb(II) and Cr(III) from aqueous solutions through batch studies. Batch adsorption studies revealed that Pb(II) and Cr(III) follow pseudo-second-order kinetics during adsorption onto the homogenous surface of MISFNPs. Besides, we also found that the adsorption of Pb(II) and Cr(III) on nanoparticles followed an endothermic process.

This study addressed isoform-specific caspase transcript expression and genetic variability in regulatory sequences of caspases 2 and 9. Methods: Gene expression profiling was performed by quantitative real-time PCR in tumor and paired non-malignant tissues of two independent groups of patients. Genetic variability was determined by high resolution melting, allelic discrimination, and sequencing analysis in tumor and peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA of the patients. Results: CASP3 A+ B and S isoforms were over-expressed in tumors of both patient groups. The CASP9 transcript was down-regulated in tumors of both groups of patients and significantly associated with expression of hormonal receptors and with the presence of rs4645978-rs2020903rs4646034 haplotype in the CASP9 gene.

However, previous researches mainly focused on free AAs and few investigations evaluated the DBPs formation potential of combined AAs, especially combined histidine. The formation of THMs and HANs from free and combined histidine and glycine during chlorination was firstly examined and compared in this study with an emphasis on their differences. The impacts of chlorine dose, pH, ammonia nitrogen and bromide were evaluated and mechanistic formation pathways were proposed. In comparison with free AAs, combined AAs generated more chloroform (CF, 125%-671%) but less dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN, 4.66%-87.5%) at all chlorine doses. The effect of solution pH on combined AM was slighter than that on free AM. During chloramination, both free AAs and combined AAs generated much smaller amounts of DBPs, especially DCAN (<9.01%), compared with chlorination. At any bromide dose, there was more bromine merging into THMs than DHANs, especially for combined AAs. At the beginning of chlorination, the combined Ms decomposed in three different ways: hydrolysis, decarboxylation and scission, leading to differing amounts of CF and DCAN compared with the free AAs.

The most important factors controlling FO processes are performance, recyclability and cost of the draw solution (DS) used together with the FO membrane itself because they play a crucial role on the feasibility of this technology. Consequently, the selection of an appropriate DS is vital for the process efficiency, besides the required selectivity and permeance of the membrane and the efficient DS regeneration process. A wide variety of DS have been tested so far and this paper aims to review recent advances in the synthesis and selection of an appropriate DS. It provides valuable information on a new type of draw solutes based on hybrid organic-inorganic nanosystems which, at a certain extent, show synergistic properties that face some of the technology shortcomings. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are the most promising nanosystems intended for desalination because they can be readily recovered applying a magnetic field or by conventional membrane processes. This review also deals with the most important characteristics of DS based on nanoparticles (NPs) and how they affect the performance of the overall processes.

In a conventional single-phase inverter, power pulsation at twice the grid frequency appears in the input power. Hence, electrolytic capacitors having large capacitances have been connected to the DC input terminal to stabilize the input DC-bus voltage. Because the lifetime of the electrolytic capacitor is relatively shorter than that of another component, the lifetime of the inverter is affected by the capacitor. In order to prevent such a problem, a novel single-phase inverter circuit with an active power decoupling function is introduced. The pulsating power on the input DC-bus line and the pulsated energy on the input DC capacitor is transferred to the energy in a small film capacitor. Hence, the extension of the inverter lifetime can be expected by substituting a small film capacitor for the large electrolytic capacitors. In addition, the loss in the power decoupling circuit is very small; hence, the reduction in the overall conversion efficiency of the inverter can be minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a 300 W experimental setup. (C). 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2019,307,8,EB1VJ,2019/06/23

Batch tests were conducted to select the best oxidant, which establishes, in the presence of oxisol (soil rich in iron), the proper conditions for the generation of radicals. The results indicated that the H2O2 added was scavenged in the process and that CaO2, which releases H2O2 slowly, achieved the best removal results.

Some of the difficulty in obtaining responses in mammals probably lies in the conflation in the central nervous system (CNS), of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which makes the vertebrate neuroimmune response quite complex and difficult to dissect. An alternative strategy for understanding the relation between neural immunity and neural repair is to study an animal devoid of adaptive immunity and whose CNS is well described and regeneration competent. The medicinal leech offers such opportunity. If the nerve cord of this annelid is crushed or partially cut, axons grow across the lesion and conduction of signals through the damaged region is restored within a few days, even when the nerve cord is removed from the animal and maintained in culture. When the mammalian spinal cord is injured, regeneration of normal connections is more or less successful and implies multiple events that still remain difficult to resolve. Interestingly, the regenerative process of the leech lesioned nerve cord is even more successful under septic than under sterile conditions suggesting that a controlled initiation of an infectious response may be a critical event for the regeneration of normal CNS functions in the leech. Here are reviewed and discussed data explaining how the leech nerve cord sensu stricto (i.e. excluding microglia and infiltrated blood cells) recognizes and responds to microbes and mechanical damages.

The code running on the GPU is generated with the help of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The first and second spatial derivatives of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized by the sixth-order central compact finite-difference schemes. Two flow fields are simulated. The first test case is the simulated flow around a square cylinder, with the results providing good estimations of the wake region mechanics and vortex shedding. The second test case is the simulated flow around a circular cylinder. This case was selected to better understand the effects of sharp corners on the force coefficients. It was observed that the estimation of the force coefficients did not result in any troubles in the case of a circular cylinder. Additionally, the performance values obtained for the calculation time for the solution of the Poisson equation are compared with the values for other CPUs and GPUs from the literature.

Results show that the combination of ozonation, ultraviolet (UV), and electro-generation of H2O2 could lead to significant synergistic effects that enhanced the pseudo-first order rate constant for 1,4-dioxane degradation to 33 times that of the simple linear addition of the three single processes. In addition, the PEP process could mineralize total organic carbon (TOC) from 1,4-dioxane solutions much faster than the three single processes, as well as their binary combinations (UV/O-3 and the electro-peroxone (EP) process). After 45 min of treatment, the UV/O-3, EP, and PEP processes removed similar to 70%, 37%, and 98% TOC with a specific energy consumption (SEC) of similar to 0.38, 0.22, and 0.30 kW h/g TOCremoved, respectively. Increasing ozone (03) dose, applied current, and solution pH increased generally the rate of TOC removal during the PEP process. When sodium chloride (NaCl) was used as the supporting electrolyte, chlorine (Cl-2) and hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO-, formed from anodic oxidation of Cl-) would react with H2O2, thus diminishing its synergistic effects with O-3 and UV for pollutant degradation. Consequently, TOC removal was much less efficient when the PEP process was conducted in NaCl electrolytes than in sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolytes, especially when using anodes (ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium, RuO2-IrO2/Ti) with higher chlorine evolution activity. These results indicate that careful optimizations of the operational parameters are critical to maximize the synergistic effects of the PEP process for pollutant degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although biomass aerogels can remedy the mechanical brittleness in contrast to conventional silica aerogels, regrettably causing a major decrease in SSA aspect. Here we present a generalizable synthetic means towards a family of chitosan aerogels (CAs) with large internal surface area, originating from chitosan sols in ethanol/water binary medium. The as-prepared CAs show high SSA of 973 m(2) g(-1) , appropriate texture homogeneity and thermal stability, attributing to uniformly inter-associated structures. We found an emergent phenomenon that free-standing wet chitosan gel could be still produced despite greatly lowering its substance concentration, attesting the remarkable role of ethanol for promoting gelatum formation. This enhancement to gelation is due to the introduction of micro-dispersed active phases upon. ethanol/water excitation, easily forming fine interconnected skeletons of CAs. The adsorption tests of CAs for abatement of methyl orange (MO) verify that dye-treated water almost recovers into pure one, well in line with the evidence of high SSA CAs. A convincing explanation for gelling and cross-linking is also analyzed. Our work facilitates to explain the generation mechanism of gels in binary solvents for the creation of CAs with high SSA.

To do that, experiments were carried out in a pseudo-2D fluidized bed using glass beads as bed material. The glass beads have the same density and diameter but half of them are painted in black to make them distinguishable. At the beginning of each experiment, the particles were placed in a completely lateral segregated state and then the fluidizing air was suddenly injected while images were recorded. The images were processed to obtain the mixing index evolution with time. Two different regions where differentiated in the evolution of the lateral mixing with time: a region dominated by convective mixing and a region governed by diffusive mixing. Both the start-up time and the total solids mixing time were characterized. The total solids mixing time was found to have a potential relation with the excess gas velocity and it was found to be independent of the particle size. This total solids mixing time was compared to the residence time of the bubbles in the bed and it was showed that the axial solids mixing is two orders of magnitude faster than the lateral solids mixing. This result justifies the use of the 1D Fickian-type diffusion equation to fit the experimental data of the mixing index obtaining the values of the lateral dispersion coefficient. Finally, the experimental values of the total solids mixing time were compared to the experimental values of the lateral dispersion coefficient and a straightforward relation between both parameters was provided.

In insects, mediators of the stress response (e.g. stress hormones) divert molecular resources away from immune function and towards tissues necessary for fight-or-flight behaviours. For example, molecules such as lipid transport proteins are involved in both the stress and immune responses, leading to a reduction in disease resistance when these proteins are shifted towards being part of the stress response system. Stress responses also alter immune system strategies (i.e. reconfiguration) to compensate for resource losses that occur during fight-or flight events. In addition, stress responses optimize immune function for different physiological conditions. In insects, the stress response induces a pro-inflammatory state that probably enhances early immune responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2021,17,8,ED8AX,2018/12/21

Serum ferritin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and TRACP 5b were measured. Echocardiography was performed with assessment of BMD using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The BMD was decreased in patients with SCD compared with SCT and controls (P = .005), with no significant difference between the latter 2 groups. Patients with SCD had higher incidence of bone complications than SCT group and controls (P = .03). The SCD group with abnormal DXA scan had higher ferritin and ALP than normal BMD.

The assays were made in a flow plant of 2.5 L equipped with a boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion cell and a solar planar photoreactor. Main oxidants were hydroxyl radicals formed from water discharge at the BDD anode and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction between added Fe2+ and cathodically generated H2O2. Partial mineralization was achieved for all the treatments, with the relative oxidation ability growing in the sequence: AO-H2O2 < EF < SPEF. The superiority of SPEF over EF was related to the contribution of photo-oxidation of intermediates and/or their Fe(III) complexes upon sunlight irradiation. No short-linear carboxylic acids were identified, whereas heteroatoms were mainly released as NO3- and SO42- ions. For herbicide contents <= 0.18 mM in EF and SPEF, a very rapid pseudo-first-order decay kinetics was related to the oxidation of the Fe(II) complexes of each herbicide at short time, whereupon a much slower pseudo-first-order kinetics associated with the decay of their Fe(III) complexes was observed. Ametryn disappeared more quickly than tebuthiuron, but its solutions were more poorly mineralized. The effect of j and substrate concentration on the performance of SPEF was examined.

The change of relative intensities for S 2p spectra was significantly higher than that of O 1s spectra by XPS analysis.

The numerical model is validated using experimental results from the breakage of blackboard chalk sticks subject to uniaxial compression in a cylindrical container. The validated model is used to investigate particle breakage when agitated by rotating blades, which is encountered in a range of pharmaceutical processes, such as agitated filter drying, rotary tablet press feeding, and powder blending. The simulation results show that the breakage rate, that is the rate of particle size reduction (or the rate of fragment mass increase), increases as the applied pressure, impeller rotational speed, particle-particle friction, or particle-equipment friction increases. However, the extent of breakage per impeller revolution is independent of impeller rotational speed. Most importantly, it is found that the extent of particle breakage is a function of the work performed on the material, and the parameters in this function depend on the particle-particle and particle-wall friction coefficients.

The photocatalytic data showed that Ni2P/Cd0.5Zn0.5S had higher activity than pure Cd0.5Zn0.5S for photocatalytic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation in the absence of any scavengers. After 1 h visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm), the concentration of NH3 reached to 101.5 mu mol L-1. And the quantum efficiency at 420 nm monochromatic light reached 4.32%, which much higher than other semiconductors. Time -resolved PL spectra, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectroscopy revealed that higher photo -induced carrier separation efficiency of Ni2P/Cd0.5Zn0.5S. This work introduced Cd0.5Zn0.5S solid solution photocatalyst to reduce nitrogen, and offered a greenly, economically and efficiently way for nitrogen fixation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Test mass is defined as a stationary mass, which is located in different places of the beam modelled by Timoshenko beam theory. The beam with an arbitrary number of cracks is modelled as segments connected by elastic springs illustrating open edge cracked cross-sectional flexibilities. The stiffness of the springs is determined using fracture mechanics theory. Solving the differential equations, the eigenfunctions of the problem are explicitly derived. Rayleigh's quotient method is then used to consider the effect of the test mass. Consequently, natural frequencies of the cracked beam with a test mass are derived for each mode of transverse vibration. Knowing the natural frequencies of the beam carrying a test mass at some different locations, it is possible to identify cracks' parameters (i.e. location and depth) by solving the system of equations. The proposed closed-form approach is also validated using numerical studies on multiple-cracked beam examples. There is quite encouraging agreement between the results of the present approach and those numerically computed using the finite element method.",2019,331,15,EF1JQ,2019/07/16

It is critical to quantify the interaction between climate warming and crop management on sugarcane phenology to understand the adaptation of crop to climate change. Similarly, in crop modeling, parameterizing the phenology of new crop varieties is a major challenge. Historical changes between 1980 and 2014 in spring and autumn sugarcane phenology have been observed in Punjab, Pakistan. Planting, emergence, stalk elongation, peak population and harvest dates advanced by a mean of 2.87, 2.63, 4.47, 5.01 and 6.41 d decade(-1), respectively for spring sugarcane, and were delayed by 6.59, 6.21, 4.38, 3.13 and 2.17 d decade(-1), respectively for autumn sugarcane.

The Limestone Chemical Looping Combustion process (LCL-C (TM)) registered by Alstom Power Inc. proposes the use of a continuous CaCO3 feeding together with coal to produce CaSO4 as an oxygen carrier via sulphur retention. The operation is similar to what happens in a circulating fluidized bed boiler burning coal. In the present research work, the study of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations together with mass and enthalpy balances have been carried out for a CLC system in order to investigate whether the LCL-C (TM) process is a promising and energy efficient option to carry out the coal combustion with CO2 capture and in-situ desulphurisation. So, no limitations were found to transfer the required oxygen from air to fuel using sulphated limestone as oxygen carrier for whatever coal used. The selection of a suitable oxygen carrier to fuel ratio mainly depends on the sulphur content of the coal used. In addition, no drawback referred to thermal integration in the system has been detected. Thus, operation at 950 degrees C in the fuel reactor to avoid SO2 release via side reactions, and 1050 degrees C in the air reactor is feasible. Likewise, experimental tests have been performed in a thermogravimetric analyser to evaluate the capability of a limestone to be sulphated and to transfer oxygen. A value of the oxygen transport capacity of about 16.7 wt.% was obtained. This value is four times higher than that of others typical inexpensive oxygen carriers published in literature.

Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses demonstrated that the morphologies and topographies of the fabricated membranes were significantly affected by the preparation method of MnO2 particles. Subsequently, sodium alginate was employed to investigate the antifouling properties of the fabricated membranes. Although the incorporation of MnO2 particles increased membrane intrinsic resistance to varying degrees, M-MnO2 and S-MnO2 apparently mitigated both reversible and irreversible fouling in the presence of ozone, whereas C-MnO2 exerted a minor influence.

Imipenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacter isolates were genotyped. Additionally, beta-lactamase genes were screened using PCR, and the expression of efflux pump and porin genes was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. A total of 31 isolates (8.7%) were not susceptible to imipenem. Clonal diversity of 17 imipenem-nonsusceptible E. cloacae isolates was demonstrated by multilocus sequence typing. Fourteen imipenem-nonsusceptible E. aerogenes isolates were found to be distantly genetically related by an ERIC-PCR analysis. Expression levels of porin ompD and ompIC35 genes were decreased in all imipenem-nonsusceptible E. cloacae and E. aerogenes isolates. However, only two isolates were found positive for bla(IMP) and bla(VIM) genes, and expression of the efflux pump gene, acrB, was not associated with reduced imipenem susceptibility. Imipenem resistance seems to have occurred independently in most of the imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates in this study, and decreased porin expression was found to be the main mechanism underlying this reduced susceptibility to imipenem.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy (RS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) were utilized to characterize the morphologies and properties of the particles. The mechanism of the photocatalytic reduction of bromate by FGT was also discussed. The results show that a narrow band gap for an FGT composite with a cuboid morphology and (0 01) facet was found. The transportation of photogenerated electron and the depression of electron-hole pairs recombination were improved by the co-doping of GO and F in TiO2. Moreover, high activity was exhibited in the photocatalytic reduction of bromate. Over 90% of bromate could be removed with a 0.05 g/L, dosage of 1.0% F and 0.1% GO co-doped TiO2 composite in 15 min under UV irradiation at an intensity of 26 mu W/cm(2) and pH of 5.2. A lower pH was favorable for the photoreduction by affecting the adsorption, which was necessary for the rapid removal. In addition to spherical particles, FGT possesses cuboid morphologies with (0 0 1) and (1 0 1) facets, which would help to promote the migration of electrons and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The results indicate that FGT is a promising material for bromate reduction in water treatment due to its remarkable efficiency and stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many effect factors for the alkylation of thiophenic sulfides catalyzed by [Bmim]H2PW12O40 have been fully investigated. Under the optimal reaction conditions (the catalyst dosage 1 wt%, reaction temperature 120 degrees C, reaction time 40 min and the stirring rate 500 rpm), the conversions of T, 2-MT and 3-MT all can nearly reach up to 100%.

To synthesize the biogenic MISFNPs, we used the seed extract of Cnidiummonnieri (L.) Cuss (CLC) as a precursor. The prepared MISFNPs was characterized using PXRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDX, SEM, BET, AFM and XPS. We also investigated the size, surface area, structure and magnetic properties of MISFNPs. Additionally, magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) studies show that our prepared MISFNPs was superparamagnetic at room temperature. Further, we used the MISFNPs for the removal of Pb(II) and Cr(III) from aqueous solutions through batch studies. Batch adsorption studies revealed that Pb(II) and Cr(III) follow pseudo-second-order kinetics during adsorption onto the homogenous surface of MISFNPs.

Further, safe disposal of the spent biosorbent in glass form was established which is significant for commercial implementation of the biosorption technology. Zn(II) and Cd(II) showed 99% removal within 10 min while Ni(II) and Co(II) attained 98% removal at 20-24 h. The biosorbent showed >96% removal efficiency for these metals in effluents from battery manufacturing industry with simultaneous removal of Pb, Cu and Fe ions. Chemical modification of hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, sulfonyl and carbonyl functional groups were undertaken and surface characterization of the biosorbent was done using zeta-potential, FTIR, FESEM-EDX and XPS technique to elucidate the biosorption mechanism. The biosorption efficiency was found to decrease significantly indicating involvement of functional groups in metal binding which was confirmed by FT-IR. Rapid removal of Zn (II) and Cd(II) was due to binding with functional groups. However, the gradual removal of Ni(II) and Co(II) was governed by ionic exchange mechanism, confirmed by ICP-AES. Deconvolution of N1s and Cis XPS spectra produced two and one additional peaks respectively, suggesting formation of amino-metal complexes.

Methods: We searched Pubmed, CINAHL, Embase, Popline and the Cochrane Library for articles from inception of database through December 2015. For outcomes specific to IUD use (IUD expulsion and perforation), we examined effect measures for um users generally aged 25 years or younger compared with older IUD users. For outcomes of pregnancy, infection, pelvic inflammatory disease (ND), and heavy bleeding or anemia, we examined young IUD users compared with young users of other contraceptive methods or no method. Results: We identified 3169 articles of which 16 articles from 14 studies met our inclusion criteria. Six studies (Level II-2, good to poor) reported increased risk of expulsion among younger age groups compared with older age groups using copper-bearing (Cu-) IUDs. Two studies (Level II-2, fair) examined risks of expulsion among younger compared with older women using levonorgestrel-releasing (LNG-) IUDs; one reported no difference in expulsion, while the other reported increased odds for younger women. Four studies (Level II-2, good to poor) examined risk of expulsion among Cu-and LNG-IUD users combined and reported no significant differences between younger and older women. For perforation, four studies (Level II-2, fair to poor) found very low perforation rates (range; 0%-0.1%), with no significant differences between younger and older women. Pregnancies were generally rare among young IUD users in nine studies (Level I to II-2, fair to poor), and no differences were reported for young IUD users compared with young combined oral contraceptive (COC) or etonogestrel (ENG) implant users. PID was rare-among young IUD users; one study reported no cases among COC or IUD users, and one reported no difference in PlD among LNG-IUD users compared with ENG implant users from nationwide insurance claims data (Level I to II-2, fair). One study reported decreased odds of bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with COC use among young women, while one study of young women reported decreased odds of removal for bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with ENG implant (Level I to II-2, fair). Conclusion: Overall evidence suggests that the risk of adverse outcomes related to pregnancy, perforation, infection, heavy bleeding or removals for bleeding among young IUD users is low and may not be clinically meaningful. However, the risk of expulsion, especially for Cu-IUDs, is higher for younger women compared with older women. If IUD expulsion occurs, a young woman is exposed to an increased risk of unintended pregnancy if replacement contraception is not initiated.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces. It might be of interest to explore the transfer of colloids along or inside real surfaces (being a mosaic of nano-or micro-scale domaines with specific interactions).",2020,157,18,ED1EC,2019/10/10

However, K2CO3/AC would suffer a decreased CO2 sorption capacity due to sorbent deactivation in acid impurities such as SO2 and NO2. To solve this problem, water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and polyethyleneimine (PEI) modification were proposed as efficacious means for improving its CO2 sorption capacity and mitigating the sorbent deactivation in these acid impurities. CO2 sorption performances of the pretreated and modified sorbents were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor under simulated ECLSS conditions of 20 degrees C, 1.0% CO2, 2.0% H2O, 30 ppm SO2, 20 ppm NO2 and balanced N-2. The mechanisms for sorbent deactivation inhibition by water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and PEI modification were revealed by N-2 adsorption desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Effects of water vapor pretreatment duration, KOH addition and PEI loading on sorbent deactivation inhibition performances were demonstrated. Furthermore, the long-term working stabilities of the pretreated and modified sorbents in impurities were evaluated. The results will provide fundamental support on practical application of K2CO3/AC for low concentration CO2 removal in ECLSS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,95,3,ED8AX,2018/05/12

The efficacy of currently available medications is unsatisfactory owing to their limited effect size and the low responder rate (less than 50%). Thus, there is a large unmet need for innovative therapies for chronic pain. Areas covered: In this review, the author points out the need for fundamental reforms in pain research. For the last several decades, drug discovery research has extensively focused on designing new therapies using animal models of chronic pain. It has, however, made insufficient progress with respect to the launch of innovative analgesic drugs, because the translation from preclinical to clinical stages has not been satisfactory. Thus, the strategies for developing innovative analgesic drugs are discussed. Expert opinion: Points to be considered in the discovery of drugs for pain relief include: (1) the exclusion of bias incorporation and the alignment of clinical and preclinical endpoints in the assessment of analgesic efficacy; (2) the understanding of primary unmet needs; (3) the assessment of new therapies by biomarker-prioritized frameworks, and (4) the stratification of chronic pain sufferers.",2022,667,12,EF2VG,2019/03/17

In order to overcome the drawbacks of high energy consumption and severe environmental pollution in conventional treatments, a novel electrochemical advanced oxidation process was first reported for the V2O3 oxidative extraction in alkaline media. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified electrode was employed to produce hydrogen peroxide via two-electron-pathway oxygen reduction reaction, following by the Cr(III)-induced activation process to generate highly oxidative (OH)-O-center dot radical. The oxidative dissolution ratio was affected by the alkaline concentration, and the V(III) was completely transferred within 160 min treatment at the pH of 13. Subsequently, the vanadium and chromium were selectively recovered by a solvent extraction method. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy and quenching reagents were performed to probe the reaction mechanism and main reactive species, indicating that the heterogeneous electro-catalytic oxidative dissolution process was mainly attributed to the in-situ generated (OH)-O-center dot. Furthermore, the long-term stability test illustrates the excellent durability of the MWCNTs modified electrode. Therefore, this novel method offers a promising solid waste treatment approach, and new insight on the electrochemical advanced oxidation process in alkaline media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies postulated a possible connection between plasmatic hypercoagulability and progression of fibrosis. The aim of the study was to investigate disorders of the coagulation system in patients with chronic hepatitis C having different extent of hepatic fibrosis well defined by liver histology. A total of 62 patients with chronic hepatitis C were recruited and categorized into 2 groups according to their histological fibrosis stage : mild/moderate fibrosis group (F0-F3 group, n = 30) and extensive fibrosis/cirrhosis group (F4-F6 group, n = 32). The control group consisted of 31 healthy individuals. The following hemostatic assays were evaluated: antithrombin III (AT), protein C (PC) activity, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen as well as conventional liver function test. The PC level exhibited a significant reduction in both patient groups when compared to the normal control group (89.25% +/- 10.05% and 48.33% +/- 15.86% vs 111.86 +/- 10.90; P < .001 and P < .001). The PC was found to be the strongest associated factor to histological fibrosis stage (r = -.834; P < .0001). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that AT (P = .003) and PC (P = .0001) were the most important factors associated with advanced fibrosis. The PC (P = .001) was found to be the only predictor of mild fibrosis. In conclusion, PC deficiency occurs in an early stage of liver fibrosis. The severity of deficiency is proportional to extent of fibrosis.

This large immunoregulatory receptor family also consists of multiple receptor-types with variable signaling abilities that is dependent on their inherent or acquired tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic tail (CYT) regions. For example, IpLITR 2.6b associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecule fpFcRy-L, and when expressed in mammalian cells it activates phagocytosis using a similar profile of intracellular signaling mediators that also regulate the prototypical mammalian Fc receptor (FcR) phagocytic pathway. Alternatively, IpLITR 1.1b contains a long tyrosine-containing CYT with multifunctional capabilities including both inhibitory and stimulatory actions. Recently, we demonstrated that IpLITR 1.1b activates a unique phagocytic pathway involving the generation of multiple plasma membrane extensions that rapidly capture extracellular targets and secure them on the cell surface in phagocytic cup-like structures. Occasionally, these captured targets are completely engulfed albeit at a significantly lower rate than what was observed for IpLITR 2.6b. While this novel IpLITR 1.1b phagocytic activity is insensitive to classical blockers of phagocytosis, its distinct target capture and engulfment actions depend on the engagement of the actin polymerization machinery. However, it is not known how this protein translates target recognition into intracellular signaling events during this atypical mode of phagocytosis. Using imaging flow cytometry and GST pulldown assays, the aims of this study were to specifically examine what regions of the IpLITR 1.1b CYT trigger phagocytosis and to establish what profile of intracellular signaling molecules likely participate in its actions. Our results show that in stably transfected AD293 cells, the membrane proximal and distal CYT segments of IpLITR 1.1b independently regulate its phagocytic activities. These CYT regions were also shown to differentially recruit various SH2 domain-containing intracellular Mediators, which provides new information about the dynamic immunoregulatory abilities of IpLITR 1.1b. Overall, this work further advances our understanding of how certain immunoregulatory receptor-types link extracellular target binding events to the actin polymerization machinery during anon-classical mode of phagocytosis.

The asymmetric feeding of solids can be caused by the designed-geometry of J-bend right before the riser inlet or unbalanced operation of wall-steam feeding. In order to ensure uniform distributions in local catalytic to oil ratio (CTO) and temperature, a possible measure of matching the asymmetric feed of catalysts is to introduce liquid jets in an accordingly asymmetric feeding. The asymmetric feeding will cause complicated three-phase interactions, in terms of the transport and phase change characteristics of each interacting phase, in the feed zone of a riser reactor. This study has developed a theoretical framework with an inertia-based multi-spray interaction, which considers not only a complex geometric intervene of mutual-penetration sprays but also the individual spray properties and feeding operations. Based on the fact that the traverse gradient of pressure is insignificant compared to that of axial gradient in a riser flow, a sub-model is also established to redistribute the gas and solid phases within the cross-section of concern. Due to the lack of experiment data or available information on the asymmetric feeding of catalysts from J-bend, we have also conducted a CFD study of a J-bend dense gas solid flow to obtain the asymmetric distribution catalysts feeding to the feed-zone model. Our modeling examples suggest that the reaction and flow characteristics can be altered noticeably by adjusting asymmetric feedings of liquid reactants, such as changes in droplet penetration, spray coverage and local CTO. In addition, the result of over-penetration of droplets onto the feed zone wall shows the need for a various droplet size/flowrate model rather than mono-sized/constant-flowrate model of liquid phase. This can also assist in better design or selection of the characteristics for the spray nozzle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,66,12,ED7LT,2017/08/24

These catalysts suffer a severe catalyst deactivation by coke, which has been characterized quantitatively and qualitatively by TG-TPO, MS/FTIR-TPO, FEIR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies. The first part of this work delves with the product distribution and deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite based catalyst during the transformation of (pure) aqueous glycerol. The second section focuses on the product distribution and deactivation of HY zeolite based catalyst during the joint cracking of vacuum-gas-oil (VGO) with aqueous glycerol. The results show that the mechanism of deactivation during glycerol cracking, independently of the catalyst used, involves two sequential steps: (i) condensation in the exterior of the zeolite to form an oxygenated coke and (ii) dehydration and hydrogen transfer of the previous oxygenated coke to form a more aromatic one. The second step is only activated at severer conditions (t > 3 s and T > 450 degrees C). Co-feeding glycerol with VGO increase the yield of coke, gases and decrease the yield of gasoline (with higher octane number), while VGO only participates in the formation of aromatic coke.

The assays were made in a flow plant of 2.5 L equipped with a boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion cell and a solar planar photoreactor. Main oxidants were hydroxyl radicals formed from water discharge at the BDD anode and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction between added Fe2+ and cathodically generated H2O2. Partial mineralization was achieved for all the treatments, with the relative oxidation ability growing in the sequence: AO-H2O2 < EF < SPEF. The superiority of SPEF over EF was related to the contribution of photo-oxidation of intermediates and/or their Fe(III) complexes upon sunlight irradiation. No short-linear carboxylic acids were identified, whereas heteroatoms were mainly released as NO3- and SO42- ions. For herbicide contents <= 0.18 mM in EF and SPEF, a very rapid pseudo-first-order decay kinetics was related to the oxidation of the Fe(II) complexes of each herbicide at short time, whereupon a much slower pseudo-first-order kinetics associated with the decay of their Fe(III) complexes was observed. Ametryn disappeared more quickly than tebuthiuron, but its solutions were more poorly mineralized. The effect of j and substrate concentration on the performance of SPEF was examined. Mixtures of both formulations were efficiently treated by SPEF, showing similar but slower decays than single solutions. Four primary heteroaromatic products were detected by GC-MS upon prolonged electrolysis of an equimolar mixture.

The Fe-0 before and after magnetization was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), suggesting the acceleration of Fe2+ release after magnetization. The effects of some important operating parameters such as Fe-0 dosage, PS dosage, pH, and initial 2,4-DCP concentration on the 2,4-DCP degradation and dechlorination by Pre-Fe-0/PS were investigated and compared with that of Fe-0/PS, observing a 1.9-5.2-fold enhancement in the degradation rate of 2,4-DCP. Although SO4- was the dominant active species responsible for 2,4-DCP degradation in two processes, pre-magnetization could promote more OH generation.

However, K2CO3/AC would suffer a decreased CO2 sorption capacity due to sorbent deactivation in acid impurities such as SO2 and NO2. To solve this problem, water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and polyethyleneimine (PEI) modification were proposed as efficacious means for improving its CO2 sorption capacity and mitigating the sorbent deactivation in these acid impurities. CO2 sorption performances of the pretreated and modified sorbents were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor under simulated ECLSS conditions of 20 degrees C, 1.0% CO2, 2.0% H2O, 30 ppm SO2, 20 ppm NO2 and balanced N-2. The mechanisms for sorbent deactivation inhibition by water vapor pretreatment, KOH addition and PEI modification were revealed by N-2 adsorption desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Effects of water vapor pretreatment duration, KOH addition and PEI loading on sorbent deactivation inhibition performances were demonstrated. Furthermore, the long-term working stabilities of the pretreated and modified sorbents in impurities were evaluated. The results will provide fundamental support on practical application of K2CO3/AC for low concentration CO2 removal in ECLSS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2020,22,13,ED5YS,2019/08/23

In the nanocomposites, Ag and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles with sizes of several nanometers are homogeneously anchored on the surface of RGO sheets. The RGO/Ag/NiCo2S4 nanocomposites are used as electrode materials for supercapacitors and their capacitive performance are investigated. It is found that their capacitive performances are remarkably affected by the Ag content. The RGO/Ag/NiCo2S4 nanocomposites exhibit excellent specific capacitance as high as 2438 F g(-1) at the current density of 2.0 A g(-1), good rate capability with a specific capacitance of 1410 F g(-1) at the high current density of 20 A g(-1), and high cycling stability with 85.4% capacitance retention after 2000 charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 10 A g(-1). The enhanced capacitive performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect among NiCo2S4, Ag and RGO, in which RGO sheets serve as an ideal support matrix and Ag nanoparticles act as conductive channels. The remarkable capacitive performance of RGO/Ag/NiCo2S4 makes it a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We describe the results of the observational extension study, ACCORDION MIND (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no.

Participants (mean diabetes duration 10 years; mean age 62 years at baseline) received a fourth cognitive assessment and a third brain MRI, targeted at 80 months post-randomisation. Primary outcomes were performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and total brain volume (TBV). The contrast of primary interest compared glycaemic intervention groups at the ACCORDION visit; secondary contrasts were the BP and lipid interventions. Of the surviving ACCORD participants eligible for ACCORDION MIND, 1328 (68%) were re-examined at the ACCORDION follow-up visit, approximately 47 months after the intensive glycaemia intervention was stopped. The significant differences in therapeutic targets for each of the three interventions (glycaemic, BP and lipid) were not sustained.

Methods: The study reviewed data from 6873 women in four WHO-HRP randomized trials on EC conducted between 1993 and 2010. Participants took either 1.5 mg of LNG as a single dose or in two doses 12 h apart, up to 120 h of unprotected intercourse. Contraceptive efficacy (pregnancy rates) at different weight and BMI categories was evaluated. Results: Overall pregnancy rate was low at 1.2%. Pregnancy rates were also low in women weighing over 80 kg (0.7%) and who were obese (BMI over 30 kg/m(2)) (2.0%). The pooled analyses for pregnancy demonstrated that BMI over 30 kg/m2 decreased efficacy significantly (odds ratio 8.27, 95% confidence interval = 2.70-25.37) when compared to women in lower BMI categories, mainly influenced by pregnancies in obese women from one study site. Sensitivity analyses excluding that site showed that obesity was no longer a risk factor; however, the other studies included too few obese women in the sample to exclude a substantial decrease in efficacy. Conclusions: Pregnancy rates with use of LNG 1.5 mg for EC were low at less than 3% across different weight and BMI categories.

In this study, we report the first oyster JNK gene homolog (ChJNK) and its biological functions in the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. The ChJNK protein consists of 383 amino acids and contains a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase (S_TKc) domain with a typical TPY motif. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ChJNK shared a close evolutionary relationship with Crassostrea gigas JNK. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed broad expression patterns of ChJNK mRNA in various adult tissues and different embryonic and larval stages of C hongkongensis. When exposed to Vibrio alginolyticus or Staphylococcus haemolyticus, ChJNK mRNA expression levels were significantly up-regulated in the hemocytes and gills in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, sub cellular localization studies that ChJNK is a cytoplasm-localized protein, and that its overexpression could significantly enhance the transcriptional activities of AP-1-Luc in HEK293T cells.

Different approaches for modular plant design have been developed, for example in the CoPIRIDE or F-3 factory project. They have in common that reductions in design and construction expenses for modular equipment and its assembly are expected e.g. by preassembly of modules in a workshop under controlled conditions resulting in less field work on the construction site for erection. However, the main disadvantage of the modular approach is the loss of economy of scale. Thus, the effective impact of the modular concept concerning the fixed capital investment has to be investigated. In this article, a new approach for estimating fixed capital investment of modular production plants will be presented and applied using a generic example. Based on the results we expect that positive effects through modularization on engineering and construction costs can nearly compensate the loss of economy of scale. In the investigated example investment costs of the modular plant are 12% higher than for the comparable conventionally built plant. Such increase could allow other effects that are attributed to the modular concept to be employed to advantage.

These catalysts suffer a severe catalyst deactivation by coke, which has been characterized quantitatively and qualitatively by TG-TPO, MS/FTIR-TPO, FEIR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies. The first part of this work delves with the product distribution and deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite based catalyst during the transformation of (pure) aqueous glycerol. The second section focuses on the product distribution and deactivation of HY zeolite based catalyst during the joint cracking of vacuum-gas-oil (VGO) with aqueous glycerol. The results show that the mechanism of deactivation during glycerol cracking, independently of the catalyst used, involves two sequential steps: (i) condensation in the exterior of the zeolite to form an oxygenated coke and (ii) dehydration and hydrogen transfer of the previous oxygenated coke to form a more aromatic one. The second step is only activated at severer conditions (t > 3 s and T > 450 degrees C). Co-feeding glycerol with VGO increase the yield of coke, gases and decrease the yield of gasoline (with higher octane number), while VGO only participates in the formation of aromatic coke.

The findings suggest that the invasive nature of SpaciMS depends on its configuration and application. Using monoliths with a range of cell densities (100-600 cells per square inch, CPSI), the concentration profiles of propylene sampled with probes of two different outer diameters (170 and 363 mu m) are compared with the temperature measured using coherent optical frequency domain reflectometry (c-OFDR). The comparison indicates that flow blockage has a negligible effect if the limiting propylene is depleted in the downstream reactor section. Suction by the probe compensates for the blockage for certain combinations of the channel diameter and probe size. In such cases the profile measured by a probe with the larger outer diameter (363 m) is similar to that measured by a smaller capillary (170 m). The experiments reveal that the axial position of the probe does not influence the flow profile in a 100 CPSI monolith channel, nor does it affect the amount of flow deflected to surrounding channels for a 600 CPSI monolith. Under some conditions the results are impacted by transverse concentration gradients. Their existence complicates the interpretation of the SpaciMS data. The difference between the location of propylene depletion and temperature maximum provides a useful metric for capturing the collective impacts of flow deflection and transverse gradients. The complexity of the flow, transport and reaction suggests that at least three dimensionless groups are needed to bound the operating regions in which the presence of the probe has minimal impact on the measured concentration.

In batch experiments, per sulfate was compared with H2O2 and permanganate for oxidation of organic compounds in CGW. Complementary experiments were conducted to evaluate biodegradation (natural attenuation) potential for the system. Persulfate was observed to be superior to H2O2 and permanganate for degradation of total organic carbon (TOC) in the CGW. Conversely, biodegradation caused only partial removal of TOC in CGW. In contrast, persulfate caused complete degradation of the TOC in the CGW or aged CGW, showing no selectivity to the contaminants. Magnetite (Fe3O4) enhanced degradation of leachate compounds in both CGW and aged CGW with limited increase in persulfate consumption and sulfate production. Under dynamic flow condition in 1-D column experiment, both biodegradation and persulfate oxidation of TOC were enhanced by Fe3O4. The enhancement, however, was significantly greater for persulfate oxidation. In both batch and column experiments, Fe3O4 by itself caused minimal consumption of persulfate and production of sulfate, indicating that magnetite is a good persulfate activator for treating CGW in heterogeneous systems The results of the study show that the persulfate-based in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) method has great potential to treat the groundwater contaminated by landfill leachate.

However due to the sensitivity of glass to thermal shock and the considerably temperature-dependent behaviour of interlayer materials as a result of their visco-elastic nature, the mechanical behaviour of laminated glass will be severely influenced by exposure to fire. Relatively little research has been conducted in the past to study the response of load bearing structural glass, and laminated glass in particular to radiant heating. This paper represents an effort to try to understand the effects of through depth radiation absorption and temperature conduction through laminated glass with a view to ultimately developing a model for studying load bearing glass exposed to elevated temperatures, such as those that would be expected in a fire. The paper reports on an experimental research programme in which several monolithic and laminated glass configurations were exposed to a radiant heat flux to study the different phenomena that occur upon exposure to fire conditions, including the ratios of absorbed, transmitted and reflected heat flux to the incident heat flux. The paper then presents a numerical heat transfer model which is developed based on these experimental results and that is able to determine the evolution of the temperature profile as a result of a given incident heat flux. The effectiveness of the heat transfer model is demonstrated through comparison with the temperatures measured during the experimental work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that approximately 95-99% of emulsified oil was successfully removed by the co-precipitation/adsorption process. In addition, highly basic conditions and lower temperatures were preferred for IGMHs to remove emulsified oil. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the co-precipitation/adsorption process was spontaneous, exothermic and physical in nature, involving weak interactions, such as electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and adhesive force between the emulsified oil droplets and the binding sites on the surface of IGMHs. It was observed that IGMHs lost approximately 18.9% adsorption capacity for emulsified oil after more than four cycles. Therefore, IGMHs could be used effectively for at least four cycles. Moreover, recovery of oil from oily wastewater could improve the economic viability of this treatment process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2021,60,5,EF1RS,2018/11/24

At sufficiently high sulphide flux, microgalvanic corrosion can be supported between areas of the surface covered by compact sulphide deposits and other areas covered only by a porous deposit. This leads to excessive crystal growth at the cathodes (compact film) and localized corrosion damage at the anodes (porous film). The transport of Cu(I) between the two areas, required to sustain this process, appears to occur predominantly by the solution transport of Cu-sulphide complex or clusters.

Activation of Fe(VI) resulted in increased oxidative transformation of caffeine (psychostimulant, CAF), acesulfame potassium (artificial sweetener, ACE), and atenolol (beta-blocker, ATL) by 30% within in seconds to minutes. Moreover, without acid addition to Fe(VI)-contaminant solution (un-activated Fe (VI)), the transformation of contaminants occurred in minutes to hours at similar pH conditions. CAF and ACE could be removed almost completely by activated Fe(VI). In the case of ATL, which was recalcitrant to Fe(VI) alone, the enhancement by activated Fe(VI) was also seen. A possible reason for the augmentation of oxidative transformation of organics may be the increasing formation of reactive intermediate species, Fe-V/Fe-IV, in the Fe(VI)-contaminant-acid mixed solution. Acid-activated Fe(VI) could decontaminate the sluggishly reactive or non-reactive pollutants by involving Fe-V/Fe-IV species, which increased electron equivalents per Fe(VI) (i.e. oxidation capacity) in oxidation processes to achieve higher removal efficiencies at reduced amount of Fe(VI) and shorter reaction times, than non-activated Fe(VI).

In the current study, in vitro T lymphocyte activation measured by IFN gamma release was significantly higher in B2 versus B19 haplotypes. AIV infection of macrophages was required to activate T lymphocytes and prior in vivo exposure of chickens to NP AIV plasrnid enhanced responses to infected macrophages. This study suggests that the demonstrated T lymphocyte activation is in part due to antigen presentation by the macrophages as well as cytokine release by the infected macrophages, with B2 haplotypes showing stronger activation. These responses were present both in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA showed greater IFN gamma release of B19 haplotype cells, further indicating the greater responses in B2 haplotypes to infection is due to macrophages, but not T cells. In summary, resistance of B2 haplotype chickens appears to be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response and the role macrophages play in activating adaptive immunity.

When designing these bubble columns it is important to be able to predict the conditions that mark the transition from homogeneous (bubbly) to heterogeneous (churn-turbulent) flow. The transition is a function of many variables, including: liquid and gas superficial velocities, bubble diameter, and liquid and gas physical properties. Linear stability analysis (LSA) has been successfully applied by many researchers to determine the gas volume fraction at which the instability takes place; and correspondingly a one dimensional stability factor, f(1), has been proposed (see for example Joshi et al. (2001)). Briefly, the LSA analysis utilises the velocity fluctuations of both the dispersed and continuous phases associated with the specific energy dissipation rate of the two phase mixture. Typically, the specific energy dissipation rate is correlated with the density of the bed. The previous analysis, however, does not consider the energy input which associated with the turbulence intensity (velocity fluctuations) of the incoming liquid stream. Usually, this component can be ignored in sparged bubble columns because its magnitude is relatively small and it also decays in the axial direction. In plunging liquid jet bubble columns the liquid is introduced as a high speed jet that entrains gas which is then broken into fine bubbles in the Mixing Zone. The bubby mixture then passes into the Two Phase Flow Zone where instabilities can be generated. The Mixing Zone is a region of high energy dissipation resulting in relatively large liquid velocity fluctuations, which can directly influence the instability of the Two Phase Flow Zone. In this study the existing linear stability analysis is modified to include the influence of inlet liquid velocity fluctuations on the stability parameter, f(1). The modified theory is applied to the previous work of Evans (1990) for a plunging liquid jet bubble column to determine the critical gas volume fraction at which transition takes place in the Two Phase Flow Zone. In order to apply the model, drift-flux analysis has been used to obtain bubble diameter as a function of gas and liquid superficial velocities, and computational fluid dynamics has been utilised to quantify the velocity fluctuations of the liquid exiting the Mixing Zone.

The ground powders of the former are hydrated by only adding water at 80 degrees C for 3 days and 20 degrees C for subsequent time. Some one-part geopolymers gain satisfying compressive strengths and are quite water-resistant similar to the two-part ones. It is found that alkali alters and deepens the thermal decomposition of the bentonite and transforms quartz impurity into X-ray amorphous cementing-active glassy phases. Nepheline is usually generated in the alkali fused bentonite, and gehlenite also occurs when calcined at 1000 degrees C. Different kinds of zeolites appear in the one-part geopolymers, while the calcium ferrites, only found in the precursors exclusively activated by Na2CO3, lead to produce additional hydrous gehlenite, so Na2CO3 seems facilitates hydration more effective than NaOH given the pastes from the precursors calcined with Na2CO3 possess higher compressive strengths. Moreover, the ferric oxide and calcium oxide have potential to enhance the cementing properties according to the mechanisms with calcination and hydration. The low hydrolysis rate might lead to poor water-resistance and the softening coefficient of the pastes increases with alkali content and calcination temperature for one-part geopolymers.

In-depth characterizations confirmed a compact core-shell formation with a dense graphite-like structure PDA on every HMX crystal. The phase transition temperature of the crystals (beta phase -> delta phase) was improved by 27.5 degrees C for HMX enabled in 0.5 wt% FDA. In situ XRD showed that 94.8% of beta-HMX was transformed to delta-HMX, whereas only 14.7% of beta-HMX was transformed in HMX with 2.1% PDA at 210 degrees C. The heated HMX/PDA crystals (210 degrees C, 30 min) retained primary morphology, with intact PDA shell, demonstrating the excellent ability of PDA to prevent thermal damage in energetic crystals. The impact sensitivities of HMX and HMX/PDA were tested by Bundesanstalt fur Materialprufung (BAM) method. No difference between HMX (impact energy: 5.0 J) and HMX/PDA (5.0 J) at room temperature was attributed to the rigid PDA shell, which was benefit for phase transition, but inefficient for reducing sensitivity. After being heated at 200 degrees C for 30 min, the impact energy of HMX showed a dramatically drop (2.0 I), while that of HMX/PDA unchanged (5.0 J), indicating the increased sensitivity of HMX after thermal damage, and retardation of phase transition is benefit for the safety of polymorph explosives.

Methods: We searched PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between 1990 and 2015. We identified and reviewed primary studies that examined the following points and were relevant to the Asia-Pacific region: available types and utilization rates of IUC and factors that influence these. We also obtained the opinions of local experts to gain a better understanding of the situation in specific countries. Results: Types of IUC used and utilization rates vary widely across the region. Factors influencing rates of utilization relate to healthcare systems, such as government policy on and subsidization of IUC, types of healthcare providers authorized to place IUC and local guidelines on preinsertion screening. Healthcare provider factors include concerns around pelvic inflammatory disease and the suitability of IUC in certain groups of women, whereas end-user factors include lack of awareness of IUC, concerns about safety, cultural or religious attitudes, access to IUC and costs. Conclusions: Across the Asia-Pacific region, clear data gaps and unmet needs exist in terms of access to and uptake of IUC.

In both reactors, the mass transfer coefficients were predicted successfully not only in the homogeneous regime but also in the heterogeneous regime (superficial gas velocities up to 0.08 ms(-1)). The results in the article demonstrate the importance of the geometrical characteristics (length and height) of the oblate ellipsoidal bubbles for the accurate calculation of the contact time and thus the volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient K(L)a. The gas-liquid interfacial area has been calculated in both reactors in the classical way, i.e. as a function of the gas holdup and inversely proportional to the Sauter-mean bubble diameter. It was found that in the gas-liquid bubble column (0.095 m in ID) the modified penetration theory was applicable to tap water, 9 organic liquids (decalin, nitrobenzene, 2-propanol, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol (99%), tetralin, xylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, ethylene glycol) and two liquid mixtures (water-glycol and tetralin-ethanol). Tetralin was aerated with both nitrogen and helium, whereas xylene was aerated with hydrogen and helium. The correction factor introduced by Calderbank (1967) was found useful for improving the kip predictions in 1,2-dichloroethane, ethanol (99%), xylene(-hydrogen) and toluene-ethanol 97.2%. In the case of a slurry bubble column, the new approach was found applicable (at low solids concentrations) to four different gas-liquid-solid systems: air-tetralin-Al2O3, air-water-Al2O3, air-water-activated carbon and air-Na2SO4-kieselguhr. It is noteworthy that in some cases (air-water-Al2O3) the new definition of the contact time was found applicable up to solids concentrations of 62.9%. In the case of a slurry bubble column, it was found that when the theoretical kip value is multiplied by the inverse value of the correction factor the predictions improve with about 5%. Finally, in the slurry bubble column the contact time was defined on the basis of the length of the micro eddies and the K(L)a values in both air-water-alumina and air-water-activated carbon systems were successfully predicted. This is also a potentially good approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2019,309,8,EF1FR,2019/07/02

Three composites were prepared namely AC/Ce, AC/Fe, and AC/Ce/Fe. The composites were investigated for the simultaneous desulfurization of thiophene, benzothiophene (BT), and dibenzothiophene (DBT) in a model fuel. The surface structures, morphologies, and pore structures were characterized. The unloaded AC had the highest surface area and pore volume of 460.27 m(2)/g and 0.71 cm(3)/g respectively. Moreover, the unloaded AC showed the highest surface oxygen-containing groups but performed the least in desulfurization. The adsorptive desulfurization efficiency followed the order: AC < AC/Fe < AC/Ce < AC/Ce/Fe. The AC/Ce/Fe performed the best in the adsorption of thiophene (31%), BT (30%), and DBT (75%) despite having the least surface area and pore volume of 430.44 m(2)/g and 0.64 cm(3)/g. All the adsorbents showed a greater affinity to the large size DBT. Batch and column experiments carried out using AC/Ce/Fe revealed a high absorptive capacity and breakthrough for DBT i.e. 16 mg/g. The kinetic data showed a synergistic effect of surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion occurring concurrently, and the results complied with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption results are well fitted to the Freundlich isotherm indicating a heterogeneous adsorption process. Thermal regeneration experiments carried out on AC/Ce/Fe showed stable efficiency in the adsorptive desulfurization after regeneration cycles. The regeneration properties displayed by the adsorbent could enhance its practical application in an industrial setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017,14,8,ED4OG,2019/07/29

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether co-transplantation of human non-endothelial bone marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), which are non-immunogenic and can secrete angiogenic growth factors during the initial days after implantation, could improve islet engraftment and survival. Islets (150) were co-transplanted, with or without human MAPCs (2.5 x 10(5)) as separate or composite pellets, under the kidney capsule of syngeneic alloxan-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Blood glucose levels were frequently monitored and IPGTTs were carried out. Grafts and serum were harvested at 2 and 5 weeks after transplantation to assess outcome. Human MAPCs produced high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the induction of neo-angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Islet-human MAPC co-transplantation as a composite pellet significantly improved the outcome of islet transplantation as measured by the initial glycaemic control, diabetes reversal rate, glucose tolerance and serum C-peptide concentration compared with the outcome following transplantation of islets alone. Histologically, a higher blood vessel area and density in addition to a higher vessel/islet ratio were detected in recipients of islet-human MAPC composites. The present data suggest that co-transplantation of mouse pancreatic islets with human MAPCs, which secrete high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, enhance islet graft revascularisation and subsequently improve islet graft function.",2019,308,18,ED8AX,2019/04/29

Herein, we report a homolog of BPI/LBP from black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) (designated as RfBPI/LBP) and characterize its structural and functional features at the molecular level. We identified the putative complete open reading frame (1422 bp) of RJLBP that encodes a 474 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of similar to 51.5 kDa. The primary protein sequence of Rfl3PI/LBP contains domain features of BPI/LBP family proteins and shares significant sequence consistency with its homologs. Our phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated the vertebrate ancestral origin of RfBPI/LBP, further reinforcing its evolutionary relationship with teleostean homologs. Recombinant RfBPI/LBP demonstrated in vitro LPS-binding activity and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, but not against Streptococcus iniae. Moreover, RfBPI/LBP exhibited temporal transcriptional activation against pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Collectively, our findings suggest that RfBPI/LBP plays an essential role in host antimicrobial defense, plausibly through selective eradication of invading bacteria. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

But, a puzzling question remains to be answered, as to how intronless type I IFN genes in amniotes might have evolved from intron-containing type I IFN genes in fish and amphibians. In this study, intronless and intron-containing type I IFNs were found in the amphibian model, Xenopus tropicalis, with a total of sixteen and five genes, respectively. The intronless IFNs can be divided into three subgroups, and the intron-containing ones into two subgroups, implying that a retroposition event might have occurred in amphibians, resulting in the generation of intronless type I IFN genes. Two models were tentatively proposed to explain the evolution of type I IFNs in vertebrates: in model A, fish should possess the most primitive multi-exon-containing type I IFNs, and intronless type I IFN genes in amphibians are the ancestor of modern intronless type I IFNs in amniotes; in model B, intronless type I IFN genes in X. tropicalis may just represent an independent bifurcation in this species or probably in amphibians, and intronless type I IFN genes in amniotes may have arisen from another retroposition event occurred in a transition period even when reptiles were diverged from amphibians. It is considered that the model B can reflect the current knowledge on the occurrence of intronless and intron-containing type I IFN genes in vertebrate lineages. This study thus contributes to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of type I IFNs in vertebrates, and of the occurrence of intronless I IFNs in higher vertebrates.

The new inlet model is validated by the comparison of the model prediction with experiments and the CFD simulation incorporating the full geometry of gas distributor for bubble columns of small or large diameters. Comparisons of three different inlet boundary conditions, i.e., the direct simulation of gas distributor, the uniform inlet, and the new inlet model, are made in the simulation of the total gas holdup, the radial profiles of gas holdup at different cross-sections along the column height, and the axial velocity of liquid at various superficial gas velocities.

Confinement was provided with the use of a polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) tube and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrappings or FRP with a sandwiched layer of foam to enhance impact energy reduction due to potential FRP rupture and PVC fracture. In the present paper, additional flexural tests on CCFPT columns were undertaken to further investigate the structural behavior of the proposed system for column construction in seismic regions. Axial and flexural behavior of CCFPT columns was investigated with compressive and flexural tests, respectively, and compared with those of their corresponding concrete-filled polyvinyl-chloride tubular (CFPT) and FRP-wrapped (FW) columns. Test results obtained from 152 x 305 mm (6 x 12 in.) stub columns under axial loads and 152 x 1524 mm (6 x 60 in.) flexural beams under four-point loads indicated that the CCFPT columns can significantly enhance strength over the CFPT columns and enhance ductility over the FW columns. The transverse confining pressure from FRP wrapping and the interface property between the FRP and PVC proved critical in CCFPT design. Furthermore, the idea of introducing a cushioning foam layer between FRP layers and PVC to lessen the brittleness of FRP rupture in seismic regions proved effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Holm oak was used as real lignocellulosic biomass to be treated. In the fractionation reactor, hemicellulose and cellulose were solubilized and partially hydrolyzed in different stages with the aim of feeding the hydrolysis reactor with high C5 or C6 concentrations respectively. The fractionation was performed in two stages: at 180 degrees C optimizing the hemicellulose extraction and at 260 degrees C extracting cellulose and hard hemicellulose remaining in the biomass structure. Three water flows were tested: 11, 17 and 26 cm(3)/min. Sugar yields from 71 to 75% were reached, mainly composed of xylose and glucose oligomers and lower amounts of other chemicals, like retro-aldol products, acetic acid or 5-HMF. The outlet stream from the fractionation reactor was directly mixed with sub or supercritical water at the inlet mixer of a supercritical hydrolysis reactor where the reaction time was precisely controlled. The temperature, pressure and reaction time were modified to get an insight of their effect on the yield of retro-aldol condensation products. Yields of 24% for glycolaldehyde, and pyruvaldehyde were found at 83 s, 350 degrees C and 162 bar (hydrolysis reactor conditions). On other hand, 25% of lactic acid was found at 0.23 s, 396 degrees C and 245 bar. A discussion based on a known reaction pathway is proposed. Moreover, a kinetic model for the hydrolysis reactor was put forward, being able to reproduce the experimental data with deviations below 10% for sugars and other products extracted.

Investigation using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled tPA revealed that the tPA-loaded MBs were successfully fabricated in a one-step procedure and the tPA was located in the shell layer for both the BSA and lipid MBs. By optimization of the operating conditions in terms of voltage, core/shell flow rate ratio as well as tPA volume ratio, minimum bubble sizes for tPA-BSA and tPA-lipid MBs were obtained. The fabricated tPA-BSA MBs was 41 mu m in mean diameter while similar to 41% of the tPA-lipid MBs ranged from 3 to 6 mu m and similar to 36% of them ranged from 6 to 9 mu m under optimal operating conditions. Sensitivity analysis on the effects of key process parameters was also performed to guide design and manipulation of bubble sizes. The investigation of gas phase showed that the usage of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as the core can enhance the stability of tPA-lipid bubbles.

Similar narrow-crowned, cylindrical teeth from Cenomanian-to Coniacian-age strata in the Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan, may belong to a closely related taxon. Another taxon, with teeth that are pentagonal in cross-section, is known from the Santonian Yalovach and Bostobe formations of Tajikistan and western Kazakhstan, respectively. A femur reported from the Santonian Syuksyuk Formation of southern Kazakhstan possibly belongs to a lithostrotian titanosaur. The change in tooth structure at the Coniacian-Santonian boundary in the region possibly suggests replacement of non-lithostrotian titanosaurs by lithostrotians. The titanosaur from the Bissekty Formation is similar to Dongyangosaurus sinensis from the Cenomanian-Turonian of Zhejiang (China) in the extensive pneumatization of the neural arch on the anterior caudal vertebrae with several fossae. It also resembles Baotianmansaurus henanensis from the Cenomanian of Henan (China) in the possession of very short anterior caudal centra. These three taxa possibly represent an as yet formally unrecognized endemic Glade of Asian non-lithostrotian titanosaurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,158,4,EB1VJ,2018/06/06

An attempt has been made here to collect and organize current literature and provide an insight to most topics of the ongoing scientific conversation on CFWs. Several issues are discussed such as applications, construction materials, vegetation species, mechanisms for pollutant removal and management strategies. Raw data were extracted from studies and were imposed to statistical analysis in order to reveal correlations (Spearman's r coefficient) between total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration reduction and several operational or design parameters, e.g., vegetation aerial coverage, water depth, initial loading, Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR) and Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). TN concentration reduction correlated well with initial loading (r = 0.841; p = 0.000; n = 28) and showed a lower correlation with HRT (r = 0.443; p = 0.013; n = 28), and negative correlations with depth (r = -0.690; p = 0.000; n = 28) and HLR (r = -0.528; p = 0.002; n = 28). NH4+-N and TP concentration reductions correlated positively with initial loading (r = 0.869; p = 0.000; n = 19 and r = 0.840; p = 0.000; n = 21), and negatively with depth (r = -0.812; p = 0.000; n = 19 and r = -0.773; p = 0.000; n = 21) and HLR (r = -0.608; p = 0.02; n = 19; and r = -0.558; p = 0.06; n = 21). As the depth factor relates to the percent of root coverage in the water column, the aforementioned negative correlation for TP, TN and NH4+ with depth could be interpreted as the rhizosphere effect. Multi-linear regression analysis was carried out for TN and TP removal, in an attempt to describe quantitatively TN and TP concentration reduction as function of design and operation parameters. CFWs seem to be an efficient technique for both wastewater treatment and natural water purification; however, further research is needed in order to better interpret system's behavior and optimize its efficiency.

The effects of Mg source, alkaline agent, capping agent and calcination temperature were evaluated on the catalytic properties of MgO. It was found that MgO prepared with magnesium acetate as Mg source, NH4OH as alkaline agent, surfactant as capping agent, and calcination at 500 degrees C had the highest catalytic activity for acetaminophen (ACT) degradation. As-made MgO was a nanocrystalline nanoparticle with BET specific surface area of 257.3 m(2)/g and a high density of basic surface functional groups. The prepared catalyst had a high catalytic activity of 71.5% in degradation and of 62.8% in mineralization of ACT. Complete degradation and 94% mineralization of ACT attained in the MgO/O-3 process at the reaction times of 15 min and 30 min, respectively. Reaction with free center dot OH was the main mechanism involved in the ACT oxidation using the MgO/O-3 process. MgO could preserve its catalytic activity during the consecutive use in the process. Therefore, the MgO prepared using the novel method is an efficient and durable catalyst for ozonation of emerging water contaminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the difficulty in obtaining responses in mammals probably lies in the conflation in the central nervous system (CNS), of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which makes the vertebrate neuroimmune response quite complex and difficult to dissect. An alternative strategy for understanding the relation between neural immunity and neural repair is to study an animal devoid of adaptive immunity and whose CNS is well described and regeneration competent. The medicinal leech offers such opportunity. If the nerve cord of this annelid is crushed or partially cut, axons grow across the lesion and conduction of signals through the damaged region is restored within a few days, even when the nerve cord is removed from the animal and maintained in culture. When the mammalian spinal cord is injured, regeneration of normal connections is more or less successful and implies multiple events that still remain difficult to resolve. Interestingly, the regenerative process of the leech lesioned nerve cord is even more successful under septic than under sterile conditions suggesting that a controlled initiation of an infectious response may be a critical event for the regeneration of normal CNS functions in the leech. Here are reviewed and discussed data explaining how the leech nerve cord sensu stricto (i.e. excluding microglia and infiltrated blood cells) recognizes and responds to microbes and mechanical damages.

Recently cleaved transferrin products was shown to activate macrophages in vitro. We now use an in vivo model of self-resolving peritonitis in goldfish, coupled with gene expression and protein analysis to evaluate the contributions of cleaved transferrin to acute inflammation. We show, for the first time, that cleaved transferrin products are produced in vivo early during an acute inflammatory response. These cleaved transfetrin fragments were produced during pathogen-induced, but not sterile, inflammation. Both macrophages and neutrophils were able to contribute to transferrin cleavage. However, only macrophages contributed to this innate process through inducible expression of transferrin. The appearance of transferrin cleavage products in vivo correlated with the influx of leukocytes but did not necessarily correlate the induction of robust respiratory burst and nitric oxide responses. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of work highlighting the role of transferrin as an immune regulator during acute inflammation. Given the significant conservation of this and related molecules, these findings have potentially broad implications for host defences and inflammation control across evolution.

However, it always takes several months to start up a biofilm filter. In this study, by oxidizing manganese and ferrous ion from raw water using potassium permanganate continuously, an iron manganese co-oxide filter film (MeOx) was formed quicldy on the surface of virgin quartz sand in a pilot scale filter, and the start-up period was less than 30 days. Interestingly, 90% ammonium and manganese could be removed by the filter film even after the bacteria were inactivated completely in both the filter film and raw water (by aerating ozone and injecting hydrogen peroxide), suggesting that microorganisms may play a negligible role in our system. Additionally, the filter film exhibited high oxidation activity when the temperature was down to 6.6 degrees C. The filter film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods. Finally, a chemical catalytic oxidation mechanism for ammonium removal was proposed by the analysis of the oxidation process. Ammonium was oxidized to nitrate through the process of catalytic oxidation, generating hydrogen ions. MeOx plays as a catalyst, and the intermediates O-center dot can potentially serve as both oxidant and reductant in one-electron-transfer reactions with NH4+ and O-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Three varieties of TRAb have been described: stimulating (S-TRAb), blocking (B-TRAb), and apoptotic (A-TRAb) autoantibodies. Very recently, the first immunoassay method (Immulite TSI assay, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) declared to measure serum S-TRAb concentration, has been made available in an automated commercial platform. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of this new test to identify patients suffering from GD, in comparison with two current IMA methods for total TSH receptor autoantibodies (T-TRAb) measurement. Methods: Sera of 383 subjects [72 patients with untreated GD, 55 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), 36 patients with multinodular non-toxic goiter, 100 patients with other non-thyroid autoimmune diseases (NTAD) and 120 healthy subjects (HS)] were evaluated. Results: The threshold obtained by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 0.54 IU/L, very similar to that proposed by the manufacturer (0.55 IU/L). -Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) were-positive in all GD patients and negative in all but three controls (clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98.7%, respectively). Passing and Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plot showed an acceptable agreement between TSI Immulite assay and other two immunoassay methods (Cobas/Elecsys, Roche and TRAK RIA, BRAHMS Thermo Scientific). Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of fully automated Immulite TSI assay in GD patients is at least comparable to that of current TRAb immunoassays (IMAs) suggesting the possibility of including such assay in rapid and cost-saving diagnostic and monitoring algorithms. However, our results do not provide full evidence that this assay is specific for S-TRAb only, and future studies comparing Immulite TSI assay to stimulating activity are required.",2019,69,7,EC2HA,2019/08/21
001bf,"Taamallah, S; Bombois, X; Van den Hof, PMJ","Treatment of ex-situ soil-washing fluids polluted with petroleum by anodic oxidation, photolysis, sonolysis and combined approaches",English,Correction,"Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) leukocyte immune-type receptors (IpLITRs) control various innate immune cell effector responses including the phagocytic process. This large immunoregulatory receptor family also consists of multiple receptor-types with variable signaling abilities that is dependent on their inherent or acquired tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic tail (CYT) regions. For example, IpLITR 2.6b associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecule fpFcRy-L, and when expressed in mammalian cells it activates phagocytosis using a similar profile of intracellular signaling mediators that also regulate the prototypical mammalian Fc receptor (FcR) phagocytic pathway. Alternatively, IpLITR 1.1b contains a long tyrosine-containing CYT with multifunctional capabilities including both inhibitory and stimulatory actions. Recently, we demonstrated that IpLITR 1.1b activates a unique phagocytic pathway involving the generation of multiple plasma membrane extensions that rapidly capture extracellular targets and secure them on the cell surface in phagocytic cup-like structures. Occasionally, these captured targets are completely engulfed albeit at a significantly lower rate than what was observed for IpLITR 2.6b. While this novel IpLITR 1.1b phagocytic activity is insensitive to classical blockers of phagocytosis, its distinct target capture and engulfment actions depend on the engagement of the actin polymerization machinery. However, it is not known how this protein translates target recognition into intracellular signaling events during this atypical mode of phagocytosis. Using imaging flow cytometry and GST pulldown assays, the aims of this study were to specifically examine what regions of the IpLITR 1.1b CYT trigger phagocytosis and to establish what profile of intracellular signaling molecules likely participate in its actions. Our results show that in stably transfected AD293 cells, the membrane proximal and distal CYT segments of IpLITR 1.1b independently regulate its phagocytic activities. These CYT regions were also shown to differentially recruit various SH2 domain-containing intracellular Mediators, which provides new information about the dynamic immunoregulatory abilities of IpLITR 1.1b. Overall, this work further advances our understanding of how certain immunoregulatory receptor-types link extracellular target binding events to the actin polymerization machinery during anon-classical mode of phagocytosis.

More specifically, (i) we review molecular and cellular interactions between hormones of the HPG axis, and, as far as known, the involved mechanisms on immune functions, (ii) we evaluate whether the HPG-immune crosstalk serves as proximate mechanism mediating reproductive-immune trade-offs, and (iii) we ask whether the nature of the HPG-immune interaction is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, despite the changes in immune functions, reproductive modes, and life histories. In all vertebrate classes studied so far, HPG hormones have immunomodulatory functions, and indications exist that they contribute to reproduction-immunity resource trade-offs, although the very limited information available for most non-mammalian vertebrates makes it difficult to judge how comparable or different the interactions are. There is good evidence that the HPG-immune crosstalk is part of the proximate mechanisms underlying the reproductive-immune trade-offs of vertebrates, but it is only one factor in a complex network of factors and processes. The fact that the HPG-immune interaction is flexible and can adapt to the functional and physiological requirements of specific life histories. Moreover, the assumption of a relatively fixed pattern of HPG influence on immune functions, with, for example, androgens always leading to immunosuppression and estrogens always being immunoprotective, is probably oversimplified, but the HPG-immune interaction can vary depending on the physiological and envoironmental context. Finally, the HPG-immune interaction is not only driven by resource trade-offs, but additional factors such as, for instance, the evolution of viviparity shape this neuroendocrine-immune relationship.

It takes the form of a channel composed of active faces on which surface plasma is generated in AC sinusoidal mode with a resonant power-supply. The chemical application targeted is the flexible and low energy-cost abatement of VOC present in air at low concentration, which is a major current industrial concern for safety and environmental reasons. Regarding the mechanical action, the SDBD acts as a pump. It is able to induce flow rates reaching up to 153 L/min for a 60 W consumption with an electro-mechanical yield of 0.0133% in open configuration, while as any pump, it falls down in connected configuration; 39 L/min connected to our air treatment bench. Regarding the chemical action, five VOC are tested, two ketones: acetone and butanone, two esters: methyl-butyrate and methyl-valerate, one aldehyde: butyraldehyde. They are injected at low concentration in a continuous air flow according to two modes of injection: (i) separately at 25 ppmv, or (ii) together at 10 ppmv each one, i.e. 50 ppmv total. The air flow rate is modulated via an additional pump for investigating an extended range: 8.5-179 L/min. Thus, for a fixed 60 W consumption, the specific input energy (SIE) goes from 20 J/L to 423 J/L. As expected, the results show that as the SIE is increased, better conversion rates are achieved.

After systematical optimization of treatment conditions, Fe-0/OMt (0.1 g/L) with sparging O-3 (concentration of 4 mg/L) demonstrated excellent degradation efficiency for TBBPA and BPA (98.6% and 94.7%, respectively) with the initial concentration of 10 mg/L. Notably, in the aforementioned oxic conditions, bromide ions, ferrous ion, and hydroxyl radicals were detected during the progressive degradation of the TBBPA and BPA, suggesting that TBBPA was debrominated as the primary step then completely mineralized by oxidative process. Finally, combined with the analysis of degradation products identified by LC-MS, pathways of TBBPA and BPA over Fe-0/OMt were proposed. These results revealed that a Fe-0/OMt based on advanced oxidation technology is of great potential for remediating TBBPA and BPA in aqueous environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A new inlet model is therefore proposed in this paper to simplify the modelling of gas distributor and meanwhile maintain the simulation accuracy. The new inlet model is validated by the comparison of the model prediction with experiments and the CFD simulation incorporating the full geometry of gas distributor for bubble columns of small or large diameters. Comparisons of three different inlet boundary conditions, i.e., the direct simulation of gas distributor, the uniform inlet, and the new inlet model, are made in the simulation of the total gas holdup, the radial profiles of gas holdup at different cross-sections along the column height, and the axial velocity of liquid at various superficial gas velocities.

With the introduction of two active metal oxides (i.e. manganese and cerium oxides) at various loadings on Fe-MCM-41, the elimination of oxalic acid was increased to 83% from its initial concentration. The catalytic activity was found to strongly depend on the proportions of the active compounds. Cerium oxide was more effective active compound than manganese oxides because it led to higher degradation efficiency of oxalic acid. The iron content and the proportions of the metal oxides loadings were optimized. The application of optimum catalyst formulation (0.75 wt% manganese oxides and 1.19 wt% cerium oxide on Fe-MCM-41 with 1 wt% iron content) in the presence of ozone was found to be remarkably promising in degradation of oxalic acid. The optimum supported catalyst could practically remove 94% of the oxalic acid. It was observed that the higher adsorption of oxalic acid on the catalyst samples, the higher elimination of oxalic acid by catalytic ozonation. Therefore, it was deduced that the adsorption of oxalic acid influenced the catalytic activity of the supported catalysts. It is believed that the oxidation of adsorbed organic pollutant on the surface predominantly occurred during the catalytic ozonation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms of resistance to this compound have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms of resistance to this antimicrobial in two A. baumannii clinical isolates, respectively, susceptible (A027) and resistant (A009) to polymyxin B before and after polymyxin B exposure (A027(ind) and A009(ind)). The pmrAB and 1pxACD were sequenced and their transcriptional levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The bacterial cell morphology was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and the membrane potential was measured using Zeta-potential analyzer. The virulence of strains was studied using a Caenorhabditis elegans model. Both clinical isolates exhibited an elevation of the polymyxin B MIC after exposure to this compound. On the other hand, A027(ind) showed decreased values of MIC for f3-lactams, amino glycosides, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin and erythromycin. A027(ind) harbored two mutations in pmrB and the ISAba125 disrupting the 1pxA. In contrast, A009(ind) strain exhibited increase of pmrB transcriptional level, after polymyxin B exposure, despite the absence of mutations in the pmrAB genes. The TEM images revealed a thicker and more electron-dense peptidoglycan layer for A009 than that of A027. The exposure to polymyxin B induced a strong condensation and darkening of intracellular material, mainly in A009(ind). In addition, the surface charge of A009 was significantly less negative than the one of A027. Using the C elegans model, only A027(ind) strain showed a reduction on virulence. The diversity of polymyxin B resistance mechanisms among A. baumannii strains evaluated in this study confirms the complexity of these mechanisms, which may vary depending of the background of each strain.

The energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) model can be used at different scales to describe local and global heterogeneities as well as steady-state fluid dynamics of gas-solid fluidization. However, the same cluster diameter correlation based on energy dissipation was used in all cases, which may give a smaller cluster diameter than single particle diameter at low solids fluxes. In this paper, a description of the solids mass transfer between the dilute and dense phases in heterogeneous gas-solid flow is proposed to replace the correlation of cluster diameter to avoid some problems associated with the empirical calculation of the cluster diameter. This cluster description can facilitate the prediction of the drag coefficient at the scale of numerical cells in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at extremely low solids fluxes and the radial heterogeneity in large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with downward particle velocities near the wall.

The highest extraction was obtained in seawater samples for 75% Aliquat (R) 336 dissolved in kerosene with 18% dodecan-1-ol, after 45 min, and 800 rpm stirring rate in the sample. Efficacy of the proposed system when applied to real samples was 88.10 +/- 4.14% for Cd, and 61.47 +/- 3.00% for Ag in seawater, and 92.73 +/- 5.37% for Cd and 64.23 +/- 2.85% for Ag in a hyper-saline lagoon (70 g L-1 NaCl). In conclusion, the proposed methodology allowed a miniaturization of Ag and Cd extraction in short times, requiring lower amount of reagents and solvents, less energy as well as reducing operational cost and wastes if compared with existing liquid membrane based methods.

The effects of various parameters including MDEA concentration, desorption temperature, solution flow rate and CO2 loading on the CO2 desorption rate were studied. It was found that the CO2 desorption rate was most sensitive to the desorption temperature. The CO2 desorption almost reached equilibrium when the solution residence time was about 7 s, indicating the advantages of using microchannel reactors for rapid CO2 desorption. The value of k(L)a was in the range of 0.36-2.68 s(-1) in the experiments, which is comparable to that of absorption in microchannels and much larger than in conventional equipment.

While it ensures final quality specifications it also represents a significant part of manufacturing costs. In this work we have developed cheap acrylate and acrylamide-based affinity polymers by molecular imprinting in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). This green strategy yielded ready-to-use Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) with lock-and-key affinity for a model pharmaceutical impurity, acetamide, which has potential application in API manufacturing processes. MIPs generated, along with their corresponding non-imprinted controls, were characterized by SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), ASAP (nitrogen adsorption porosimetry), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy) and particle size distribution. Static and dynamic binding and selectivity experiments were performed in order to evaluate affinity and selectivity of the polymeric matrices for the template and molecules from the same family, benzamide and pivalamide. Better adsorption affinity results were obtained for MIPs in comparison with NIPs. Methacrylamide (MAM) based MIP showed the best performance, adsorbing 2.21 mmol.g pol(-1) of acetamide, when acetonitrile was used as co-solvent in the polymerization. MIPs also showed a higher selectivity for acetamide than for benzamide and pivalamide. Additionally, adsorption data were further correlated with Langmuir, Scatchard (as a second linearization form of the Langmuir model), Freundlich and Temkin equations. The promising results obtained in this work support the potential application of these affinity devices in API purification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,71,13,EE1NX,2019/05/15

The northern Australian tropical region is a particularly challenging environment for human physical activity and regional development projects. Increases in temperature and rainfall will exacerbate these challenges. Knowledge of past climatic trends and their impacts provides important information for prudent development planning. This paper quantifies the observed changes in temperature and rainfall across northern Australia for the period 1911-2013, based on Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) temperature and rainfall data for 4 coastal and 3 inland locations across the region. We compared two 30 yr periods, 1911-1940 and 1984-2013, to the baseline period 1961-1990 averages and SD values. Trends were identified in decadal monthly temperatures, maximum temperatures > 30 degrees C and minimum temperatures > 21 degrees C, shifts in the daily maximum and minimum temperature frequency distribution curves and changes in seasonal rainfall above and below the +/- 1 SD values. The results indicate this tropical region is now warmer and wetter compared to the 1911-1940 period with an increase in the number of days > 30 and > 33 degrees C. Coastal warming was more pronounced than at inland locations and shows seasonal variations; whilst western and central inland areas have become wetter, little trend change was apparent in the eastern rainfall. With projections of further warming, development plans for the region need to incorporate the associated deleterious impacts on human activity.

Therefore, the optimization of operating parameters, such as a reduction in reagent consumption to achieve the partial or complete decontamination of waters, is crucial in AOP application. The present study is focused on the comparison of solar and UV photo-Fenton technologies (by using H2O2 or S2O82-), for the removal of five micro-contaminants (antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) from-simulated freshwater at very low concentrations (100 ppb each one). In addition, economic assessment of the implementation of UV/H2O2, UV/S2O82-, solar/Fe(II)/H2O2 and solar/Fe(II)/S2O82- was also carried out. The total costs obtained were 0.42 (SIC)/m(3) for solar/Fe(II)/H2O2 with 50 mg/L of initial H2O2, 0.72 (SIC)/m(3) for solar/ Fe(II)/S2O82- with 50 mg/L of initial S2O82-, 0.43 (SIC)/m(3) for UV/H2O2 with 50 mg/L of initial H2O2, 0.49 (SIC)/m(3) for UV/S2O82- with 50 mg/L of initial S2O82- and 0.61 (SIC)/m(3) for UV/S2O82- with 25 mg/L of initial S2O82-. It was concluded that consumption of reagents and electricity costs coming from lamp operation in the UV process had a significant impact on the total operating cost of both technologies.

Preventing blood clots in the heart to reduce stroke and TE risk is a key goal of AF therapy. Traditional stroke risk assessment tools for patients with nonvalvular AF include the CHADS2 and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores, while long-term outcome data with the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are emerging. The goals of this review were to assess traditional therapies and existing treatment guidelines and to discuss key pharmacologic properties of the DOACS, noting how these may benefit at-risk patients with AF. This narrative review was developed on the basis of the authors' clinical knowledge, extensive reading of the literature, and broad pharmacy experience in the management of patients with AF. Limitations of oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) include slow onset of action, the need for regular monitoring of their anticoagulation effect, significant food and drug interactions, and unpredictable dose-response properties. Key clinical trial data led to the approvals of apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the United States to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. With predictable pharmacologic properties and limited drug and/or dietary interactions, the DOACs offer several benefits over traditional oral anticoagulation therapy with VKA. However, they have limitations, including the absence of immediate reversal agents and limited options for monitoring their anticoagulation effects in clinical practice.

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

The composites were characterized by various techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurement through nitrogen adsorption at cryogenic temperature. Single component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were performed at different temperatures. The selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). MOF505@GO composites showed higher porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption compared to its parent compound MOF-505. MOF-505@5G0 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 3.94 mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa, having an increase of 37.3% in comparison with the parent MOF-505. The significant improvement of CO2 uptakes could be attributed to not only new micropores and unsaturated metal sites formed in the MOF505@GO, but also enhanced surface dispersive forces of the composites. The experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4 and N-2 were well fitted with dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model.

Recently cleaved transferrin products was shown to activate macrophages in vitro. We now use an in vivo model of self-resolving peritonitis in goldfish, coupled with gene expression and protein analysis to evaluate the contributions of cleaved transferrin to acute inflammation. We show, for the first time, that cleaved transferrin products are produced in vivo early during an acute inflammatory response. These cleaved transfetrin fragments were produced during pathogen-induced, but not sterile, inflammation. Both macrophages and neutrophils were able to contribute to transferrin cleavage. However, only macrophages contributed to this innate process through inducible expression of transferrin. The appearance of transferrin cleavage products in vivo correlated with the influx of leukocytes but did not necessarily correlate the induction of robust respiratory burst and nitric oxide responses. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of work highlighting the role of transferrin as an immune regulator during acute inflammation.

First, it estimates solar cell price in Japan in the case resource allocation for R&D of crystalline silicon solar cells was not significantly reduced, but maintained almost constant level. For the projection, it does not use experience curve, but models technological progress, price reduction, of solar cell in Japan with a variable technology knowledge stock by excluding mass production effects. Second, solar cell prices in other countries are estimated based on their market share in the global solar cell production. The estimated solar cell price in Japan under the assumed resource allocation decreases by about 30% compared to the actual one and it, therefore, could be competitive to the estimated solar cell prices in China and Taiwan. In this case, Japan could maintain its top market share in the global solar cell production several years longer. Instead of the Japan's Feed-in Tariff with subsidy, net-metering without subsidy is enough for keeping almost the same internal rate of return of residential PV systems for new and existing houses. This paper will be helpful to cost-effective R&D planning by a modeling and simulation approach. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017,198,12,DX5QL,2018/06/07

The formation of a dense and continuous Cr2O3 healing layer at the border of the internal oxidation zone happens along the grain boundaries and is linked to their more efficient Cr supply. The propagation of the oxidation front is related to a local conversion of Cr2O3 in less protective FeCr2O4. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2021,668,2,EE8IL,2019/03/14

In some electronic hardware implementations, only two electrodes inject current simultaneously, and are denominated pair-wise current injection. Several possibilities of pair-wise current injection (electric current patterns) and electric potential, measurement (single-ended and differential) have been addressed in the literature. Considering pair-wise current injection, the skip-m current pattern can be defined as a pair-wise injection strategy in which the number of non-current injecting electrodes enclosed between two injection electrodes is m. Single-ended electric potential Measurements consist of measurements with a common potential reference. Differential electric potential measurements consist of pair-wise measurements between two electrodes. A theoretical analysis based on control theory is presented to show that some current and measurement pattern strategies convey less information than others. This hypothesis is verified by the analysis of the matrix containing possible measurement vectors, with respect to its rank, condition number and singular values. Additionally, a novel approach is proposed to analyse current and measurement patterns based on uncertainty estimation of difference images by the correlation matrix linearization of the reconstructed impedance matrix. The results show that single-ended potential measurements are usually better when compared to differential electric potential measurements. A conclusion supported by both points of view is that the cross current pattern (diametral) is the least informative for these symmetrical domains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During their operation, 3D objects are formed by repeating cycles of drawing a UV-curable resin with inkjet nozzles and then solidifying it with UV irradiation. In this study, the activity performed by a 3D UV inkjet printer was simulated by spin casting a 33 mu m thick layer of UV-curable resin (containing diurethanedimethacrylate and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone compounds mixed at a weight ratio of 99:1) onto a Si wafer followed by photopolymerization for 2 s at a UV irradiation of 10 mW cm(-2). Afterwards, the second resin layer with a thickness of 33 mu m was spun-cast onto the first layer and photopolymerized under the same conditions. The conversion distribution of C= C bonds in the UV-curable resin was investigated via confocal laser Ramanmicroscopy and numerical calculations, which took into account the kinetics of photopolymerization and oxygen inhibition reactions. The confocal laser Raman microscopy technique provided a unique distribution of the C=C bond conversion across the film depth. Thus, the conversion magnitude at a depth of 0 mu m was zero and increased to 0.2 at 6 mu m. Afterwards, the slope of the conversion distribution plot became moderate until the conversion reached the value of 0.43 at a film depth of 28 mu m. Between the film depths of 28 and 38 mu m, the conversion remained constant with a variation not exceeding 0.03. After that, the conversion value increased again, reaching the magnitude of 0.48 at a depth of 50 mu m and remained constant in the region between 50 and 56 mu m (with a variation not exceeding 0.04). At higher depths, the graph slope became moderate again, and the conversion value increased gradually to 0.51 at 66 mu m, after which the silicon wafer was reached. As a result, two different plateaus were observed on the conversion distribution plot: between 28 and 38 mu m and between 50 and 56 mu m (the corresponding conversion variation in these regions was below 0.05). The obtained experimental data were in good agreement with the results of numerical calculations, which attributed the existence of the two plateaus on the plot of the C=C bond conversion distribution to the formation of an oxygen-lean point. In addition, the effects of the UV intensity, irradiation time, lamination time, photoinitiator concentration, and concentration of dissolved oxygen on the oxygen concentration and conversion distributions across the depth direction have been examined. The obtained results revealed that the increases in the UV intensity, irradiation time, and photoinitiator concentration as well as the decrease in the initial dissolved oxygen concentration effectively increased the conversion of C=C bonds in the resin film and decreased the thickness of an unpolymerized layer.",2018,310,17,EF1FR,2017/09/07

The catalytic performance over MAl2O4 is poor but can be improved significantly by incorporating Pd into the lattice, resulting in NO conversion over Co-AlPd, Zn-AlPd and Cu-AlPd catalysts of approximately 95%, 90.5% and 84%, respectively, in the presence of 2% O-2 at a low temperature range of 100-350 degrees C. Both the pure and Pd-doped aluminate spinel catalysts showed the same sequences with respect to activity: Co-Al > Zn-Al > Cu-Al and Co-AIPd > Zn-AlPd > Cu-AlPd, indicating that the selection of divalent metal M is of essential importance in designing spinel catalysts and in modifying their SCR performance. Co-AlPd catalyst showed stable activity in the presence of 3% and 5% H2O at 250 degrees C, whereas the SCR reaction was promoted and a slight positive influence of the NO conversion was observed with a further increase of the H2O concentration to 5%. The presence of 100 ppm SO2 in the feed resulted in almost a 23% NO reduction at 250 degrees C for the Co-AlPd catalyst, whereas only a 1.2% decrease of NO conversion was observed with further increase in the SO2 concentration to 150 ppm, and the NO conversion recovered rapidly to approximately 82% after removing the SO2 from the feed stream.

Activation of Fe(VI) resulted in increased oxidative transformation of caffeine (psychostimulant, CAF), acesulfame potassium (artificial sweetener, ACE), and atenolol (beta-blocker, ATL) by 30% within in seconds to minutes. Moreover, without acid addition to Fe(VI)-contaminant solution (un-activated Fe (VI)), the transformation of contaminants occurred in minutes to hours at similar pH conditions. CAF and ACE could be removed almost completely by activated Fe(VI). In the case of ATL, which was recalcitrant to Fe(VI) alone, the enhancement by activated Fe(VI) was also seen. A possible reason for the augmentation of oxidative transformation of organics may be the increasing formation of reactive intermediate species, Fe-V/Fe-IV, in the Fe(VI)-contaminant-acid mixed solution. Acid-activated Fe(VI) could decontaminate the sluggishly reactive or non-reactive pollutants by involving Fe-V/Fe-IV species, which increased electron equivalents per Fe(VI) (i.e. oxidation capacity) in oxidation processes to achieve higher removal efficiencies at reduced amount of Fe(VI) and shorter reaction times, than non-activated Fe(VI).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate heterogeneous mercury oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface. The results indicate that Hg-0 is chemically adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 0 0) surface with an adsorption energy of -60.82 kJ/mol. HCl can decompose on MnFe2O4 surface to form active surface chlorine species for mercury oxidation. Both intermediate (HgCl) and final (HgCl2) products are adsorbed on MnFe2O4 (1 00) surface in a dissociative adsorption manner. Hg-0 oxidation by HCl over MnFe2O4 surface follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism in which a bimolecular reaction occurs between adsorbed Hg and active surface chlorine species. The mercury oxidation process over MnFe2O4 surface was investigated by examining the energy profile of reaction pathway.

For both the complete problem, and its single components (the filter plate and a bed of spheres of finite height) we have observed three flow regimes, depending on the Reynolds number. In each regime the flow resistance is showing a different scaling with the Reynolds number. In the Stokes flow regime the total flow resistance can be decomposed in linear independent components. The interior flows inside the filter holes and inside the packed bed follow the same correlations as hold for the single component. However, at the transition zone between filter plate and packed bed, there is a diverging flow in the first row of the packed bed, whose contribution in the flow resistance scales with the fractional hole to the power -1.5. Similar scaling exponent has been found earlier for the viscous-inertial regime with Reynolds numbers larger than 10, which has been modelled using the porous medium approach. Our findings suggest that also in the Stokes flow and the weakly flow regime the problem can also be solved with the same porous medium approach using the Navier-Stokes equation having Darcy-Brinkman terms incorporated. This investigation provides a good basis for developing more accurate analytical models for the flow resistance of membrane filters with a cake layer on top.",2017,55,18,ED9BY,2019/08/09

The TSBC is a direct ac-to-ac power converter capable of achieving bidirectional power flow as well as drawing and feeding three-phase sinusoidal input (supply-side) and output (motor-side) currents with any power factor at both sides. This paper discusses active dccapacitor-voltage control applied to the low-speed, hightorque motor drive. A specially designed downscaled system combining a 320-V, 38-Hz, 6-pole, 15-kW induction motor with a 400-V, 15-kW TSBC is constructed and tested to confirm the validity of the motor drive.

001e1,"Depreter, B; Devreese, KMJ",Metal-organic frameworks for the adsorption of gaseous toluene under ambient temperature and pressure,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Bubble columns, where the liquid is in the continuous phase and the gas phase is on the form of dispersed bubbles, are widely utilised in many industrial applications. When designing these bubble columns it is important to be able to predict the conditions that mark the transition from homogeneous (bubbly) to heterogeneous (churn-turbulent) flow. The transition is a function of many variables, including: liquid and gas superficial velocities, bubble diameter, and liquid and gas physical properties. Linear stability analysis (LSA) has been successfully applied by many researchers to determine the gas volume fraction at which the instability takes place; and correspondingly a one dimensional stability factor, f(1), has been proposed (see for example Joshi et al. (2001)). Briefly, the LSA analysis utilises the velocity fluctuations of both the dispersed and continuous phases associated with the specific energy dissipation rate of the two phase mixture. Typically, the specific energy dissipation rate is correlated with the density of the bed. The previous analysis, however, does not consider the energy input which associated with the turbulence intensity (velocity fluctuations) of the incoming liquid stream. Usually, this component can be ignored in sparged bubble columns because its magnitude is relatively small and it also decays in the axial direction. In plunging liquid jet bubble columns the liquid is introduced as a high speed jet that entrains gas which is then broken into fine bubbles in the Mixing Zone. The bubby mixture then passes into the Two Phase Flow Zone where instabilities can be generated. The Mixing Zone is a region of high energy dissipation resulting in relatively large liquid velocity fluctuations, which can directly influence the instability of the Two Phase Flow Zone. In this study the existing linear stability analysis is modified to include the influence of inlet liquid velocity fluctuations on the stability parameter, f(1). The modified theory is applied to the previous work of Evans (1990) for a plunging liquid jet bubble column to determine the critical gas volume fraction at which transition takes place in the Two Phase Flow Zone. In order to apply the model, drift-flux analysis has been used to obtain bubble diameter as a function of gas and liquid superficial velocities, and computational fluid dynamics has been utilised to quantify the velocity fluctuations of the liquid exiting the Mixing Zone.

It is in urgent need of developing efficient and safe removal methods for OPFRs. The degradation kinetics and mechanism of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), a representative OPFR, by ultraviolet-persulfate (UV/PS) were explored, and the toxicological assessment of degrading intermediate mixture was performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation proteomic technology. The results indicated that UV/PS had a high transformation efficiency of TCEP ([TCEP](0) = 3.5 mu M, [S2Og2-](0) = 175 mu M, apparent rate constant reached 0.1272 min(-1)) with the generations of three primary intermediates, including C4H9Cl2O4P (m/z 222.97, 224.97), C6H13Cl2O5P (m/z 266.99, 268.99) and C2H6ClO4P (m/z 160.98, 162.97), through the selective electron-transfer reactions induced by activated sulfate radical. Compared to that of TCEP, the Escherichia coli ATCC11303 exposed to intermediate mixture expressed 64 up-regulated proteins those primarily associated with nutrient import, energy generation, DNA protection and signal transduction. The 86 down-regulated proteins were related to DNA repair, protein turnover and stress response, suggesting that the toxicity of the degrading intermediate mixture decreased significantly. The current study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCEP and its degrading intermediate mixture on E. coli, clarifying that the UV/PS degradation is an alternative efficient and safe treatment method for TCEP.

Therefore, it is essential to have good understanding of the mass transfer characteristics and gas distribution in airlift reactors to be able to design effective reactors and to optimize aeration conditions. To accomplish this goal, experimental studies on the mass transfer characteristics, i.e. gas holdup, bubble size, interfacial area, volumetric mass transfer coefficient and liquid-side mass transfer coefficient were performed in an annulus-rising airlift reactor with Newtonian and non Newtonian fluids. A 3D electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique was used to measure local gas holdup and visualize gas distribution. The influences of aeration rate and liquid viscosity on local gas holdup and interfacial area were investigated at three axial positions along the riser. The EIT results show that the uniformity of gas distribution reduces with increasing liquid viscosity. Bubble size was observed to have a bimodal distribution in highly viscous liquids at high gas superficial velocities due to the intensified coalescence and breakup of bubbles. The maximum value of the local interfacial area is found at the fully developed flow zone in the riser. The liquid-side mass transfer coefficient was found to depend on liquid viscosity and bubble size for non-Newtonian liquids. Empirical correlations based on the experimental data obtained in this work predict well the local gas holdup and volumetric mass transfer coefficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The cancer and infectious disease epidemiology of HIV disease has markedly altered as populations are availed to the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The types of cancers occurring among those with HIV infection has broadened but the case burden in absolute numbers is very low relative to the background population. There are fewer incident cases of the AIDS-defining cancers (aggressive B-cell lymphomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cervical cancer). There is an increased risk for certain non-AIDS-defining cancers, but these occur somewhat sporadically relative to clinical trial enrollment. The changing epidemiology of cancer in HIV poses challenges as well as opportunities for participation of persons with HIV in cancer therapy clinical trials. Recent findings There are excellent examples of cancer trials that inform cancer therapy for patients with HIV infection. Examples include those from HIV-specific trials and from trials mainly focused on the background population that included patients with HIV infection. Summary Interpretation of clinical trials to guide therapy for those with HIV infection and cancer largely depends on data that does not include HIV-infected patients. The ability to extend clinical trial findings to populations not included in clinical trials remains problematic for a variety of populations, including those with HIV or AIDS. Careful prioritization of studies designed to bridge this gap is needed.

This is compared with the conventional batch extraction in parallel. Continuous operation of a process involving liquid liquid extraction and then two-phase separation is achieved instantly. For the latter a micro-scale separator is used. Compared with batch extraction, the segmented micro-flow extraction process shows order-of-magnitude faster extraction times, higher extraction ability for Co, lower extraction for Ni, and then a better selectivity between Co and Ni at industrial-matching concentration. Regular columnar slugs are observed at low flow rates and found to be a Gaussian function of the flow rates. Matched in and outlet flows indicates that extraction in micro-flow is dependent on mass transfer by molecular diffusion. Extraction efficiency is enhanced by the internal circulation flow generated within slugs. Additionally, the characteristic parameters, overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L)alpha and overall mass transfer coefficient k(L), are measured to determine the mass transfer performance. Compared with batch, much higher k(L)alpha. of Co (0.26-0.017 s(-1)) and smaller of Ni (0.053-0.013 s(-1)) are investigated in CFI. Meanwhile, 4.5 times increasement of the k(L) value of Co to Ni is observed in CFI indicating the asynchronous extraction between Co and Ni. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the hydrodynamics with phase change were very different from that without phase change. The temperature was lower than the liquid boiling point in the bottom region, and this difference decreased with increasing axial height. With phase change, the gas holdup showed a ""U"" shaped axial profile, while without phase change it showed a flat axial profile. In addition, phase change led to a much wider bubble size distribution. The results were analyzed based on the heat and mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases.

The catalysts were prepared using a nitrate solution of Pt or chloroplatinic acid as metal precursors and characterized by BET, SEM, EDS, hydrogen chemisorption, TPR and XPS spectroscopy. It was found that the activity of the catalysts depends mainly on the preparation method, NiO content, platinum dispersion, the oxidation state of platinum and a type of the used Pt precursor. The best catalytic results, both for CO and hexane oxidation, were obtained using the chlorine-free platinum catalyst containing 0.13% NiO, deposited on Al2O3/FeCr20Al5 (0.15%Pt/0.13NiO/Al2O3/FeCr20Al5). The deposition of 0.13-0.39% NiO on the washcoat prevented deep Pt migration into the washcoat and' support. The activities of the 0.15%Pt/x%NiO-Al2O3 catalysts containing 5-15% of NiO in the washcoat in oxidation of CO and C6H14 were lower than the activity of the 0.15%Pt/x%NiO/Al2O3/FeCr20Al5 catalysts.

In fuel spills, groundwater acquires high organic carbon content and a considerable amount of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene), and can be treated using In Situ Chemical Oxidation. Batch tests were conducted to select the best oxidant, which establishes, in the presence of oxisol (soil rich in iron), the proper conditions for the generation of radicals. The results indicated that the H2O2 added was scavenged in the process and that CaO2, which releases H2O2 slowly, achieved the best removal results. However, this compound has low solubility, forms precipitates and increases pH to 12. Therefore, Na2S2O8 was selected instead, once it achieved good removal results, worked at low pH values and had slow kinetics, making it suitable for groundwater remediation. Tests revealed that the concentration of iron in a ferriferous oxisol promotes proper oxidant activation, achieving 99% BTEX removal and 45% COD removal. GC-MS analysis of the oxidized samples showed the formation of intermediates (e.g. acetic acid and 1-acetic anhydride with formic acid) indicating the pathway of remediation. Despite such remarkable results, soil control sample achieved considerable DOC removal, suggesting that the use of ISCO may speed the remediation process, but the soil itself has a mechanism to degrade this kind of organic matter.

Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss anti-cancer, anti-allergy, anti-infectious, and proprietary Chinese Medicines (pCM) for various chronic diseases (such as the allergic diseases: eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis), which remain the contemporary therapeutic strategies that are being explored and developed. Drug transporters, disease specific biomarkers, pharmacophores, bioactive natural products and pharmacogenetics are some aspects of research technologies. Proprietary Chinese medicine remains one of the most popular strategies. There is however the issue of good research documentation of efficacy versus adverse effects. China has a complex healthcare system involving a large patient pool. Expert opinion: Various factors can impact drug development in China including the concurrent use of both western and Chinese medicines, pharmacogenetic variances, lack of multidisciplinary team impact on disease management and drug safety.

This paper examines ethnic disparities in prenatal care utilization by comparing two groups of ethnic minority and majority women.Design. We examine the roots of ethnic disparity in prenatal care utilization, focusing on how education and media exposure change health behaviours and lessen disparities. We rely on the 2002 Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey to draw our sample, predictors and the three dimensions of prenatal care, including timing of onset, frequency of visits, and type of provider.Results. Results from multinomial-, and binary-logistic regression provide evidence that ethnic minority women are less likely to obtain frequent prenatal care and seek care from professional providers than their majority counterparts. However, we find that ethnic minority women are more likely to obtain early care compared to ethnic majority women. Results for predicted probabilities suggest that education and media exposure positively influenced prenatal care behaviours with higher level of education and media exposure associating with accelerated probability of meeting prenatal care requirements.Conclusion.

Unfortunately, little is known about the quality of online leisure time physical activity resources provided for people with physical disabilities. Objective: To assess the quality of leisure time physical activity resources available online for people with physical disabilities. Methods: A purposive internet search was conducted to locate Canadian-developed resources that promoted leisure time physical activity for people with physical disabilities. Community disability organizations across Canada were also contacted to obtain additional resources. Resource quality was evaluated using a modified version of the Journal of the American Medical Association benchmarks to assess technical quality of health information. Other pertinent information (i.e., descriptive characteristics, targeting strategies) were also assessed. Results: None of the resources satisfied all seven technical quality benchmarks, with 4 benchmarks being the median number achieved. Resources were easily accessed from their respective websites and the majority (76.1%) provided links to additional resources related to leisure time physical activity. A limited number of resources tailored their information for a specific disability (28.4%) or age demographic (36.4%), while no resources targeted their information to individuals based on their time since disablement. Conclusion: This study highlights the concerning state of leisure time physical activity resources available online for people with physical disabilities.

The mRNA levels of IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B in the immune cells examined were highest in macrophage and monocytes. Assessment of spleen mRNA following infection with Trypanosoma carassii, a prominent protozoan pathogen of fish, revealed decrease in IL-4/13B and arginase expression 14 days post infection, followed by an increase in IL-4/13B and arginase-2 at 28 days post infection.

Long-acting reversible contraception, such as intrauterine contraception (IUC), is effective in reducing unintended pregnancy. Objective: This study aims to review access to, uptake of and influencing factors on IUC use in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: We searched PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between 1990 and 2015. We identified and reviewed primary studies that examined the following points and were relevant to the Asia-Pacific region: available types and utilization rates of IUC and factors that influence these. We also obtained the opinions of local experts to gain a better understanding of the situation in specific countries. Results: Types of IUC used and utilization rates vary widely across the region. Factors influencing rates of utilization relate to healthcare systems, such as government policy on and subsidization of IUC, types of healthcare providers authorized to place IUC and local guidelines on preinsertion screening. Healthcare provider factors include concerns around pelvic inflammatory disease and the suitability of IUC in certain groups of women, whereas end-user factors include lack of awareness of IUC, concerns about safety, cultural or religious attitudes, access to IUC and costs. Conclusions: Across the Asia-Pacific region, clear data gaps and unmet needs exist in terms of access to and uptake of IUC. We believe that several recommendations are necessary to update future practice and policy for enhanced IUC utilization so that women across this region have better access to IUC.

Sauropod remains are very rare at all these localities and represented usually only by isolated teeth. Only narrow-crowned teeth are known from the Cretaceous of Central Asia. The oldest record of such teeth is from the Aptian Sultanbobo Formation of Uzbekistan. Exposures of the Turonian Bissekty Formation at the most productive vertebrate locality in the region, Dzharakuduk in Uzbekistan, has yielded many isolated teeth and a few skeletal remains that can be attributed to a non-lithostrotian titanosaur. Similar narrow-crowned, cylindrical teeth from Cenomanian-to Coniacian-age strata in the Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan, may belong to a closely related taxon. Another taxon, with teeth that are pentagonal in cross-section, is known from the Santonian Yalovach and Bostobe formations of Tajikistan and western Kazakhstan, respectively. A femur reported from the Santonian Syuksyuk Formation of southern Kazakhstan possibly belongs to a lithostrotian titanosaur. The change in tooth structure at the Coniacian-Santonian boundary in the region possibly suggests replacement of non-lithostrotian titanosaurs by lithostrotians. The titanosaur from the Bissekty Formation is similar to Dongyangosaurus sinensis from the Cenomanian-Turonian of Zhejiang (China) in the extensive pneumatization of the neural arch on the anterior caudal vertebrae with several fossae. It also resembles Baotianmansaurus henanensis from the Cenomanian of Henan (China) in the possession of very short anterior caudal centra.

The increase of equivalence ratio (Phi) extended the velocity limits (v) of self-sustaining combustion in varying degrees for the three fuels under study. Methane presented a relatively narrow self-sustaining combustion region, low conversion (<= 25%), high CO selectivity (5-11%) and low tube wall temperature (< 250 degrees C) at Phi = 1.0 and v = 0.8-1.4 m/s. The catalytic reactivity for methane oxidization over Pt/ZSM-5 was highly activated at temperatures over 455 degrees C, this being responsible for the methane combustion performance. In the case of propane combustion processes, a homogenous reaction occurred downstream the catalyst section and led to high conversion. Under Phi = 1.0 and v = 0.8-1.4 m/s conditions, propane conversion was higher than 45% while the CO2 selectivity remained over 96%. n-Octane showed similar combustion performance than propane, with a little backward gap detected. The released heat by fuel combustion increased in the order: methane, n-octane, and propane, with the maximum heat values being 12, 19, and 32 W, respectively.

EPAIA employs a rotary pneumatic actuator to provide an adjustable compliant element in series to the gear train. The compliant element is thereby inserted between a brushless direct current motor, a gear reduction and the load. The decentralised control system consists of two control-loops and a decoupler. In a first control-loop, the interaction torque between actuator and load is controlled with a cascaded/post-compensator architecture involving a norm-optimal strictly positive-real H-2-controller to minimise the actuator output impedance. In a second control-loop, a stiffness controller continuously adjusts the pressure of the pneumatic chambers to realise a certain interaction stiffness. Since first hardware validation tests identified the occurrence of nonlinear friction effects that worsened the control performance, the control strategy has been extended with a new adaptive friction compensation scheme. This approach is based on the two-state dynamic friction model with elasto-plasticity (2SEP) for which an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) friction observer has been developed and incorporated to the decentralised control strategy. The resulting overall controller has been validated in nonlinear simulations and in a test bench under variable load conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous studies show that osteogenic differentiation is strongly correlated with magnetic strength from hypo (500 nT), weak (geomagnetic field, GMF), moderate (0.2 T) to high (16 T) SMFs. We speculated that the intensity that had positive (16 T) or negative (500 nT and 0.2 T) effects on osteoblast differentiation would inversely influence osteoclast differentiation. To answer this question, we examined the profound effects of SMFs on osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells. Here, we demonstrated that 500 nT and 0.2 T SMFs promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation and resorption, while 16 T had an inhibitory effect. Almost all the osteoclastogenic genes were highly expressed under 500 nT and 0.2 T, including RANK, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), V-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase II (Car2) and cathepsin K (CTSK), whereas they were decreased under 16 T. In addition, 16 T disrupted actin formation with remarkably decreased integrin 3 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that osteoclast differentiation could be regulated by altering the intensity of SMF, which is just contrary to that on osteoblast differentiation.

These phenomena are usually taken into account through a Suspension Balance Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the Suspension Balance Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables the description of the transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces. It might be of interest to explore the transfer of colloids along or inside real surfaces (being a mosaic of nano-or micro-scale domaines with specific interactions).",2018,22,11,ED2QD,2019/04/20

This green strategy yielded ready-to-use Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) with lock-and-key affinity for a model pharmaceutical impurity, acetamide, which has potential application in API manufacturing processes. MIPs generated, along with their corresponding non-imprinted controls, were characterized by SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), ASAP (nitrogen adsorption porosimetry), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy) and particle size distribution. Static and dynamic binding and selectivity experiments were performed in order to evaluate affinity and selectivity of the polymeric matrices for the template and molecules from the same family, benzamide and pivalamide. Better adsorption affinity results were obtained for MIPs in comparison with NIPs. Methacrylamide (MAM) based MIP showed the best performance, adsorbing 2.21 mmol.g pol(-1) of acetamide, when acetonitrile was used as co-solvent in the polymerization. MIPs also showed a higher selectivity for acetamide than for benzamide and pivalamide.

Inclusion criteria were that volunteers were healthy, aged > 18 years, had a BMI between 19 and 26 kg/m(2), and provided both written and oral informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a known chronic disease (including diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, ischaemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias) and regular use of prescription medication. The data was collected at the medical research facilities at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. The primary outcome was palmitic acid flux. Participants were blinded to intervention order, but caregivers were not. Adrenaline (epinephrine) and glucagon concentrations were higher during HH than during both HE and control treatments. NEFA levels and lipid oxidation rates (determined by indirect calorimetry) returned to control levels after 105 min. Palmitate flux was increased to control levels during HH (p = NS) and was more than twofold higher than during HE (overall mean difference between HH vs HE, 114 [95% CI 64, 165 mu mol/min]; p < 0.001). In subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, we found elevated levels of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin-1 phosphorylation 30 min after insulin injection during HH compared with both control and HE. There were no changes in the levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) or G(0)/G(1) switch gene 2 (G0S2) proteins. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR were unaffected by hypoglycaemia. Expression of the G0S2 gene increased during HE and HH compared with control, without changes in ATGL (also known as PNPLA2) or CGI-58 (also known as ABHD5) mRNA levels. These findings suggest that NEFAs become a major fuel source during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and that lipolysis may be an important component of the counter-regulatory response. These effects appear to be mediated by rapid stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) and HSL, compatible with activation of the beta-adrenergic catecholamine signalling pathway.

The continuous phase is a microwave-inert oil while the reactive droplets contain hydrosoluble monomer and initiator in an aqueous medium. Microwaves affect directly and preferentially the molecules within the reactive droplets. Addressing the challenge of a suitable millifluidic system coupled to microwave irradiation, the device has been design to answer geometrical and chemical specifications. To get around the issue of the measurement and the control of the droplet temperature while flowing inside the microwave cavity, the use of a chemical probe has been developed (azoic compound) with an assessment in the range 50-90 degrees C. The polymerization in the droplet-based millifluidic device and microwave irradiation has been successfully performed on acrylic acid under 90 W at a temperature within the range 60-70 degrees C.

While the mechanisms for the differential responses to drug therapy are unclear, variation in drug exposure with the same dosing protocol related to pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic factors may contribute. This article discusses the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to optimize therapies in SLE patients.Areas covered: Evidence on the relationship between blood levels and efficacy/toxicity of immuno-modulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and the calcineurin inhibitors that are often used in SLE.Expert commentary: Current data suggest a correlation between exposure and efficacy of HCQ and MMF in SLE. The relationship between HCQ or MMF blood concentrations and their adverse effects requires further elucidation. The serum trough level of tacrolimus does not appear to correlate with clinical response in lupus nephritis but is associated with toxic effects. Owing to the paucity of data, the optimal' blood levels of these agents in SLE have yet to be determined by large population pharmacokinetic studies. Nevertheless, TDM enables early identification of non-adherence and over-exposure to these SLE medications so that dosing adjustment can be performed to minimize toxicities and wastage.",2022,58,9,EE4EV,2020/03/13

The MgCO3 crystals were broken into small pieces and homogenously dispersed in polymer matrices via mechanical stirring to form MMMs. In particular, an amphiphilic comb polymer (CP) composed of poly(ethylene glycol) behenyl ether methacrylate (PEGBEM) and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM), i.e., PEGBEM-POEM, was found to be an effective matrix due to the specific interactions between its carbonyl oxygen atoms and MgCO3. The detailed interactions, morphologies, and structures of MgCO3 and CP/MgCO3 hybrids were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopies. The CP/MgCO3 MMM with 45 wt% MgCO3 exhibited the highest CO2/N-2 selectivity of 93.8 and CO2 permeance of 30.9 GPU (1 GPU = 10(-6) cm(3) (STP)/(s center dot cm(2)center dot cmHg)). This performance surpasses other MgCO3 MMMs prepared using commercially available polymers such as PEBAX (R) (a polyether block amide) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The improved performance resulted from the enhanced CO2 solubility by MgCO3 crystals, as confirmed by the CO2 uptake measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The main purpose of this study was to examine the criterion validity of the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-S) in Deaf adults. Method: This study included 44 adults (18-65 years) of both genders (63.6% were females) who met the inclusion criteria. Objective measures of PA were collected using accelerometers, which were worn by each participant during one week. After using the accelerometer, the IPAQ-S was applied to assess participants' physical activity during the last 7 days. Results: There was no significant correlation between the average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as measured by the accelerometer (40.1 +/- 24.5 min/day) and by the IPAQ-S (41.3 +/- 57.5 min/day). The IPAQ-S significantly underestimated the time spent in sedentary behavior (7.6 +/- 2.7 h/day vs. 10.1 +/- 1.6 h/day). Sedentary behavior and MVPA as measured by the accelerometer and the IPAQ-S showed limited agreement. Conclusions: Our results show some limitations on the use of IPAQ-S for quantifying PA among adults who are Deaf. The IPAQ-S tends to overestimate the MVPA and to underestimate sedentary behavior in adults who are Deaf. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2023,76,1,EF3QT,2019/06/15

Herein, the synthesis of cross-linked organic-inorganic polyphosphazene nanoshells (PZM) with amino-rich groups was reported via a facile condensation polymerization of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA) on silica (SiO2) nanospheres as templates. Then cuprcius oxide nanopartides (Cu2O NPs) were synthesized by simultaneous chemical reduction method on the surface of polyphosphazene nanoshells. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2@PZM@Cu spheres were incorporated into the EP to prepare samples for investigation of their flame-retardant and toxicity suppression performance. Herein, cone results indicated that the incorporation of 2 wt% SiO2@PZM@Cu obviously improved the flame-retardant performance of EP, such as 37.9% reduction in peak heat release rate and 31.3% decrease in total heat release. On the other hand, the amount of toxic CO and other volatile gas products from the EP decomposition significantly suppressed after incorporating the SiO2@PZM@Cu, implying a reduced toxicity. In addition, a mechanism for the flame retardancy and toxicity elimination was proposed. It is reasonable to believe that the enhanced flame retardancy and toxic effluents elimination for nanocomposites are attributed to synergistic effect from respective components (Cu2O NPs and PZM) plus the SiO2 spheres.

Using hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a structure-directing agent, the lamellar gamma-AlOOH with porous architectures was successfully prepared via a hydrothermal route. The hierarchical Al2O3 clusters, as the inorganic phase of resin composites, retain the unique structure of lamellar gamma-AlOOH by calcination treatment. In order to enhance the hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of Al2O3 clusters, silane coupling agent (A151) was used to modify the surface of Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation. The surface modified Al2O3 clusters exhibit excellent hydrophobicity, oleophilicity and chemical stability, owing to the tight binding of the hydrophobic functional groups on the inorganic Al2O3 clusters and the inherent stability.of the grafted hydrophobic molecule chains. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites were synthesized by suspension polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) and methacrylic acid butyl ester (MBA) on the surface modified Al2O3 clusters under microwave irradiation in the presence of coupling agents. The porous Al2O3/acrylic resin composites can effectively separate oils and organic solvents with high oil absorption rate and high oil retention capacity. Moreover, the obtained resin composites have high oil uptake capacities due to the synergy absorption of porous Al2O3 clusters and acrylic resin. These excellent performances, such as excellent oil recoverability, excellent recyclability and high oil retention capacities, endow the material to be an ideal candidate to separate a variety of organic liquids from water.

They act via nuclear estrogen receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) and/or G - protein coupled receptor - GPR30. We found expression of ER alpha, ER beta and GPR30 in carp lymphoid tissues and head kidney monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Interestingly, ER beta is also expressed in some head kidney lymphocytes but not in naive PBLs. Immune stimulation altered the cell type specific profile of expression of these receptors, which depends on both activation and maturation stage. This implies direct leukocyte responsiveness to estrogen stimulation and therefore in vitro effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in monocytesimacrophages were determined. Short-time incubation with E2 increased ROS production in PMA-stimulated cells. Results comply with mediation by GPR30, partially functioning via phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation. These results furthermore demonstrate that neuroendocrine-immune communication via estrogen receptors is evolutionary conserved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
